# FileSystemSync

Non-standard: This feature is not standardized. We do not recommend using non-standard features in production, as they have limited browser support, and may change or be removed. However, they can be a suitable alternative in specific cases where no standard option exists.

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

In the [File and Directory Entries API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API), a `FileSystemSync` object represents a file system. It has two properties.

Warning: This interface is deprecated and is no more on the standard track. Do not use it anymore. Use the [File System API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API) instead.
