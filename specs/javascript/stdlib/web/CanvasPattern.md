The `CanvasPattern` interface represents an [opaque object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type) describing a pattern, based on an image, a canvas, or a video, created by the [CanvasRenderingContext2D.createPattern()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/createPattern) method.

It can be used as a [fillStyle](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle) or [strokeStyle](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/strokeStyle).
