Note: This feature is available in [Web Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).

The `CustomEvent` interface can be used to attach custom data to an event generated by an application.

As an alternative to `CustomEvent`, you can [subclass the Event interface](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Events#adding_custom_data_–_subclassing_event) to add custom data and behavior.

Note: If used to attempt to communicate between a web extension content script and a web page script, a non-string `detail` property throws with "Permission denied to access property" in Firefox. To avoid this issue clone the object. See [Share objects with page scripts](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Sharing_objects_with_page_scripts) for more information.
