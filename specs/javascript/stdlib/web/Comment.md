The `Comment` interface represents textual notations within markup; although it is generally not visually shown, such comments are available to be read in the source view.

Comments are represented in HTML and XML as content between `<!--` and `-->`. In XML, like inside SVG or MathML markup, the character sequence `--` cannot be used within a comment.
