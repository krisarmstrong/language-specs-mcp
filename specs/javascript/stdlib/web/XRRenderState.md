# XRRenderState

Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers.

Secure context: This feature is available only in [secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS), in some or all [supporting browsers](#browser_compatibility).

Experimental:This is an [experimental technology](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental)
Check the [Browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) carefully before using this in production.

The `XRRenderState` interface of the [WebXR Device API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API) contains configurable values which affect how the imagery generated by an [XRSession](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession) gets composited. These properties include the range of distances from the viewer within which content should be rendered, the vertical field of view (for inline presentations), and a reference to the [XRWebGLLayer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRWebGLLayer) being used as the target for rendering the scene prior to it being presented on the XR device's display or displays.

When you apply changes using the `XRSession` method [updateRenderState()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession/updateRenderState), the specified changes take effect after the current animation frame has completed, but before the next one begins.

## [Instance properties](#instance_properties)

[XRRenderState.baseLayer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRenderState/baseLayer)Read onlyExperimental

The [XRWebGLLayer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRWebGLLayer) from which the browser's compositing system obtains the image for the XR session.

[XRRenderState.depthFar](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRenderState/depthFar)Read onlyExperimental

The distance, in meters, of the far clip plane from the viewer. The far clip plane is the plane which is parallel to the display beyond which rendering of the scene no longer takes place. This, essentially, specifies the maximum distance the user can see.

[XRRenderState.depthNear](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRenderState/depthNear)Read onlyExperimental

The distance, in meters, of the near clip plane from the viewer. The near clip plane is the plane, parallel to the display, at which rendering of the scene begins. Any closer to the viewer than this, and no portions of the scene are drawn.

[XRRenderState.inlineVerticalFieldOfView](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRenderState/inlineVerticalFieldOfView)Read onlyExperimental

The default vertical field of view, defined in radians, to use when the session is in `inline` mode. `null` for all immersive sessions.

[XRRenderState.layers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRRenderState/layers)Read onlyExperimental

An ordered array containing [XRLayer](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRLayer) objects that are displayed by the XR compositor.
