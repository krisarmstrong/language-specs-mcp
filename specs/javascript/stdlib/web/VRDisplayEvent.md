# VRDisplayEvent

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

Non-standard: This feature is not standardized. We do not recommend using non-standard features in production, as they have limited browser support, and may change or be removed. However, they can be a suitable alternative in specific cases where no standard option exists.

The `VRDisplayEvent` interface of the [WebVR API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) represents the event object of WebVR-related events (see the [list of WebVR window extensions](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API#window_events)).

Note: This interface was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/). It has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/).

## [Constructor](#constructor)

[VRDisplayEvent()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRDisplayEvent/VRDisplayEvent)DeprecatedNon-standard

Creates a `VRDisplayEvent` object instance.

## [Instance properties](#instance_properties)

`VRDisplayEvent` also inherits properties from its parent object, [Event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event).

[VRDisplayEvent.display](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRDisplayEvent/display)DeprecatedRead onlyNon-standard

The [VRDisplay](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRDisplay) associated with this event.

[VRDisplayEvent.reason](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRDisplayEvent/reason)DeprecatedRead onlyNon-standard

A human-readable reason why the event was fired.

## [Examples](#examples)

js

```
window.addEventListener("vrdisplaypresentchange", (e) => {
  console.log(
    `Display ${e.display.displayId} presentation has changed. Reason given: ${e.reason}.`,
  );
});
```

## [Specifications](#specifications)

This interface was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) that has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/). It is no longer on track to becoming a standard.

Until all browsers have implemented the new [WebXR APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals), it is recommended to rely on frameworks, like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), or a [polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill), to develop WebXR applications that will work across all browsers. Read [Meta's Porting from WebVR to WebXR](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/port-vr-xr/) guide for more information.
