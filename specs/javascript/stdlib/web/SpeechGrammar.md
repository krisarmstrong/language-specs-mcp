# SpeechGrammar

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The `SpeechGrammar` interface of the [Web Speech API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) represents a set of words or patterns of words for the recognition service to recognize.

Grammar is defined using [JSpeech Grammar Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/) (JSGF).

Note: The concept of grammar has been removed from the Web Speech API. Related features remain in the specification and are still recognized by supporting browsers for backwards compatibility, but they have no effect on speech recognition services.
