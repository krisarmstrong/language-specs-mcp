## [Instance properties](#instance_properties)

[MediaKeySession.closed](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/closed)Read only

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) signaling when a `MediaKeySession` closes. This promise can only be fulfilled and is never rejected. Closing a session means that licenses and keys associated with it are no longer valid for decrypting media data.

[MediaKeySession.expiration](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/expiration)Read only

The time after which the keys in the current session can no longer be used to decrypt media data, or `NaN` if no such time exists. This value is determined by the CDM and measured in milliseconds since January 1, 1970, UTC. This value may change during a session lifetime, such as when an action triggers the start of a window.

[MediaKeySession.keyStatuses](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/keyStatuses)Read only

Contains a reference to a read-only [MediaKeyStatusMap](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeyStatusMap) of the current session's keys and their statuses.

[MediaKeySession.sessionId](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/sessionId)Read only

Contains a unique string generated by the CDM for the current media object and its associated keys or licenses.

### [Events](#events)

[keystatuseschange](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/keystatuseschange_event)

Fires when there has been a change in the keys in a session or their statuses.

[message](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/message_event)

Fires when the content decryption module has generated a message for the session.

## [Instance methods](#instance_methods)

[MediaKeySession.close()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/close)

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) after notifying the current media session is no longer needed and that the CDM should release any resources associated with this object and close it.

[MediaKeySession.generateRequest()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/generateRequest)

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) after generating a license request based on initialization data.

[MediaKeySession.load()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/load)

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves to a boolean value after loading data for a specified session object.

[MediaKeySession.remove()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/remove)

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) after removing any session data associated with the current object.

[MediaKeySession.update()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaKeySession/update)

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) after loading messages and licenses to the CDM.
