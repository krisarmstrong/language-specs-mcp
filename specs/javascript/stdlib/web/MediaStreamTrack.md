The `MediaStreamTrack` interface of the [Media Capture and Streams API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API) represents a single media track within a stream; typically, these are audio or video tracks, but other track types may exist as well.

Some user agents subclass this interface to provide more precise information or functionality, such as [CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack).

## [Instance properties](#instance_properties)

In addition to the properties listed below, `MediaStreamTrack` has constrainable properties which can be set using [applyConstraints()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints) and accessed using [getConstraints()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getConstraints) and [getSettings()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getSettings). See [Capabilities, constraints, and settings](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API/Constraints) to learn how to correctly work with constrainable properties. Not doing so correctly will result in your code being unreliable.

[MediaStreamTrack.contentHint](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/contentHint)

A string that may be used by the web application to provide a hint as to what type of content the track contains to guide how it should be treated by API consumers. Allowable values depend on the value of the [MediaStreamTrack.kind](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/kind) property.

[MediaStreamTrack.enabled](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/enabled)

A Boolean whose value of `true` if the track is enabled, that is allowed to render the media source stream; or `false` if it is disabled, that is not rendering the media source stream but silence and blackness. If the track has been disconnected, this value can be changed but has no more effect.

Note: You can implement standard "mute" functionality by setting `enabled` to `false`. The `muted` property refers to a condition in which there's no media because of a technical issue.

[MediaStreamTrack.id](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/id)Read only

Returns a string containing a unique identifier (GUID) for the track; it is generated by the browser.

[MediaStreamTrack.kind](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/kind)Read only

Returns a string set to `"audio"` if the track is an audio track and to `"video"`, if it is a video track. It doesn't change if the track is disassociated from its source.

[MediaStreamTrack.label](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/label)Read only

Returns a string containing a user agent-assigned label that identifies the track source, as in `"internal microphone"`. The string may be left empty and is empty as long as no source has been connected. When the track is disassociated from its source, the label is not changed.

[MediaStreamTrack.muted](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/muted)Read only

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the track is unable to provide media data due to a technical issue.

Note: You can implement standard "mute" functionality by setting `enabled` to `false`, and unmute the media by setting it back to `true` again.

[MediaStreamTrack.readyState](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/readyState)Read only

Returns an enumerated string giving the status of the track. This will be one of the following values:

- `"live"` which indicates that an input is connected and does its best-effort in providing real-time data. In that case, the output of data can be switched on or off using the [enabled](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/enabled) attribute.
- `"ended"` which indicates that the input is not giving any more data and will never provide new data.

## [Instance methods](#instance_methods)

[MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints)

Lets the application specify the ideal and/or ranges of acceptable values for any number of the available constrainable properties of the `MediaStreamTrack`.

[MediaStreamTrack.clone()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/clone)

Returns a duplicate of the `MediaStreamTrack`.

[MediaStreamTrack.getCapabilities()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getCapabilities)

Returns an object detailing the accepted values or value range for each constrainable property of the associated `MediaStreamTrack`.

[MediaStreamTrack.getConstraints()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getConstraints)

Returns a [MediaTrackConstraints](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints) object containing the currently set constraints for the track; the returned value matches the constraints last set using [applyConstraints()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints).

[MediaStreamTrack.getSettings()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getSettings)

Returns a [MediaTrackSettings](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackSettings) object containing the current values of each of the `MediaStreamTrack`'s constrainable properties.

[MediaStreamTrack.stop()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/stop)

Stops playing the source associated to the track, both the source and the track are disassociated. The track state is set to `ended`.

## [Events](#events)

Listen to these events using [addEventListener()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) or by assigning an event listener to the `oneventname` property of this interface:

[ended](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/ended_event)

Sent when playback of the track ends (when the value [readyState](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/readyState) changes to `ended`), except when the track is ended by calling [MediaStreamTrack.stop](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/stop).

[mute](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/mute_event)

Sent to the `MediaStreamTrack` when the value of the [muted](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/muted) property is changed to `true`, indicating that the track is unable to provide data temporarily (such as when the network is experiencing a service malfunction).

[unmute](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/unmute_event)

Sent to the track when data becomes available again, ending the `muted` state.
