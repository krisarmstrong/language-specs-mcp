The `USBOutTransferResult` interface of the [WebUSB API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebUSB_API) provides the result from a call to the `transferOut()` and `controlTransferOut()` methods of the `USBDevice` interface. It represents the result from requesting a transfer of data from the USB host to the USB device.
