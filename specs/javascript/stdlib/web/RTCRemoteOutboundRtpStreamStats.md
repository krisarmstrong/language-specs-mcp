The `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` dictionary of the [WebRTC API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) is used to report statistics from a remote endpoint about its outbound RTP stream. This will correspond to an inbound stream that is currently being received by the local [RTCPeerConnection](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) object.

The statistics can be obtained by iterating the [RTCStatsReport](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCStatsReport) returned by [RTCPeerConnection.getStats()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStats) until you find a report with the [type](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/type) of `remote-outbound-rtp`.

## [Instance properties](#instance_properties)

### [Remote outbound specific statistics](#remote_outbound_specific_statistics)

[localId](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/localId)Optional

A string which is used to find the local [RTCInboundRtpStreamStats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCInboundRtpStreamStats) object that shares the same [synchronization source (SSRC)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/ssrc).

[remoteTimestamp](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/remoteTimestamp)Optional

A [DOMHighResTimeStamp](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) specifying the timestamp (on the remote device) at which the statistics in the `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` object were sent by the remote endpoint. This is different from the [timestamp](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/timestamp); it represents the time at which the object's statistics were received or generated by the local endpoint.

[reportsSent Optional 
Experimental](#reportssent)

A positive integer indicating the total number of [RTCP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTCP) Sender Report (SR) blocks sent for this [synchronization source (SSRC)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/ssrc).

[roundTripTimeMeasurements](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/roundTripTimeMeasurements)OptionalExperimental

A positive number that represents the total number of valid round trip time measurements received for this [synchronization source (SSRC)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/ssrc).

[totalRoundTripTime](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/totalRoundTripTime)OptionalExperimental

A number indicating the cumulative sum of all round trip time measurements since the beginning of the session, in seconds. The average round trip time can be computed by dividing `totalRoundTripTime` by [roundTripTimeMeasurements](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/roundTripTimeMeasurements).

### [Sent RTP stream statistics](#sent_rtp_stream_statistics)

[bytesSent Optional](#bytessent)

A positive integer indicating the total number of bytes sent for this SSRC, including retransmissions. 

[packetsSent Optional](#packetssent)

A positive integer indicating the total number of RTP packets sent for this SSRC, including retransmissions. 

### [Common RTP stream statistics](#common_rtp_stream_statistics)

[codecId](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/codecId)Optional

A string that uniquely identifies the object that was inspected to produce the [RTCCodecStats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCCodecStats) report associated with this [RTP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP) stream.

[kind](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/kind)

A string indicating whether the [MediaStreamTrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack) associated with the stream is an audio or a video track.

[ssrc](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/ssrc)

A positive integer that identifies the synchronization source (SSRC) of the RTP packets in this stream.

[transportId](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/transportId)Optional

A string that uniquely identifies the object that was inspected to produce the [RTCTransportStats](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCTransportStats) report associated with this RTP stream.

### [Common instance properties](#common_instance_properties)

The following properties are common to all WebRTC statistics objects.

[id](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/id)

A string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to produce this set of statistics.

[timestamp](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/timestamp)

A [DOMHighResTimeStamp](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp) object indicating the time at which the sample was taken for this statistics object.

[type](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/type)

A string with the value `"remote-outbound-rtp"`, indicating the type of statistics that the object contains.

## [Usage notes](#usage_notes)

The `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` object's [remoteTimestamp](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/remoteTimestamp) property provides statistics based on the received data's NTP timestamp taken from an [RTCP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTCP) Sender Report (SR) block. Be aware that the remote clock may not be synchronized with the local clock (either in current time or speed at which time elapses).
