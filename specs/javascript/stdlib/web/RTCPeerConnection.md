Initiates the creation of an [SDP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) answer to an offer received from a remote peer during the offer/answer negotiation of a WebRTC connection. The answer contains information about any media already attached to the session, codecs and options supported by the browser, and any [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) candidates already gathered.

[createDataChannel()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/createDataChannel)

Initiates the creation a new channel linked with the remote peer, over which any kind of data may be transmitted. This can be useful for back-channel content, such as images, file transfer, text chat, game update packets, and so forth.

[createOffer()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/createOffer)

Initiates the creation of an [SDP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP) offer for the purpose of starting a new WebRTC connection to a remote peer. The SDP offer includes information about any [MediaStreamTrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack) objects already attached to the WebRTC session, codec, and options supported by the browser, as well as any candidates already gathered by the [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) agent, for the purpose of being sent over the signaling channel to a potential peer to request a connection or to update the configuration of an existing connection.

[getIdentityAssertion()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getIdentityAssertion)

Initiates the gathering of an identity assertion and returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which resolves to an identity assertion encoded as a string. This has an effect only if [signalingState](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/signalingState) is not `closed`.

[getReceivers()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getReceivers)

Returns an array of [RTCRtpReceiver](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRtpReceiver) objects, each of which represents one [RTP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP) receiver.

[getSenders()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getSenders)

Returns an array of [RTCRtpSender](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRtpSender) objects, each of which represents the [RTP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTP) sender responsible for transmitting one track's data.

[getStats()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStats)

Returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which resolves with data providing statistics about either the overall connection or about the specified [MediaStreamTrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack).

[getTransceivers()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getTransceivers)

Returns a list of all the [RTCRtpTransceiver](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRtpTransceiver) objects being used to send and receive data on the connection.

[removeTrack()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/removeTrack)

Tells the local end of the connection to stop sending media from the specified track, without actually removing the corresponding [RTCRtpSender](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRtpSender) from the list of senders as reported by [getSenders()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getSenders). If the track is already stopped, or is not in the connection's senders list, this method has no effect.

[restartIce()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/restartIce)

Allows to easily request that ICE candidate gathering be redone on both ends of the connection. This simplifies the process by allowing the same method to be used by either the caller or the receiver to trigger an [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) restart.

[setConfiguration()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setConfiguration)

Sets the current configuration of the connection based on the values included in the specified object. This lets you change the [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) servers used by the connection and which transport policies to use.

[setIdentityProvider()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setIdentityProvider)

Sets the Identity Provider (IdP) to the triplet given in parameter: its name, the protocol used to communicate with it and a username. The protocol and the username are optional.

[setLocalDescription()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setLocalDescription)

Changes the local description associated with the connection. This description specifies the properties of the local end of the connection, including the media format. It returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which is fulfilled once the description has been changed, asynchronously.

[setRemoteDescription()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/setRemoteDescription)

Sets the specified session description as the remote peer's current offer or answer. The description specifies the properties of the remote end of the connection, including the media format. It returns a [Promise](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which is fulfilled once the description has been changed, asynchronously.

### [Obsolete methods](#obsolete_methods)

[addStream()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/addStream)DeprecatedNon-standard

Adds a [MediaStream](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) as a local source of audio or video. Instead of using this obsolete method, you should instead use [addTrack()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/addTrack) once for each track you wish to send to the remote peer.

[createDTMFSender()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/createDTMFSender)DeprecatedNon-standard

Creates a new [RTCDTMFSender](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCDTMFSender), associated to a specific [MediaStreamTrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack), that will be able to send [DTMF](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DTMF) phone signaling over the connection.

[removeStream()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/removeStream)DeprecatedNon-standard

Removes a [MediaStream](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) as a local source of audio or video. Because this method is obsolete, you should instead use [removeTrack()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/removeTrack).

Sent when the state of the [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) connection changes, such as when it disconnects.

[icegatheringstatechange](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/icegatheringstatechange_event)

Sent when the [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) layer's gathering state, reflected by [iceGatheringState](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/iceGatheringState), changes. This indicates whether ICE negotiation has not yet begun (`new`), has begun gathering candidates (`gathering`), or has completed (`complete`).

[negotiationneeded](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/negotiationneeded_event)

Sent when negotiation or renegotiation of the [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) connection needs to be performed; this can happen both when first opening a connection as well as when it is necessary to adapt to changing network conditions. The receiver should respond by creating an offer and sending it to the other peer.

[signalingstatechange](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/signalingstatechange_event)

Sent when the connection's [ICE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE) signaling state changes.

[track](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/track_event)

### [Obsolete events](#obsolete_events)

[addstream](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/addstream_event)DeprecatedNon-standard

Sent when a new [MediaStream](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) has been added to the connection. Instead of listening for this obsolete event, you should listen for [track](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/track_event) events; one is sent for each [MediaStreamTrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack) added to the connection.

[removestream](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/removestream_event)DeprecatedNon-standard

Sent when a [MediaStream](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) is removed from the connection. Instead of listening for this obsolete event, you should listen for [removetrack](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream/removetrack_event) events on each stream.
