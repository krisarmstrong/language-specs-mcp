Secure context: This feature is available only in [secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Secure_Contexts) (HTTPS), in some or all [supporting browsers](#browser_compatibility).

The `AuthenticatorAttestationResponse` interface of the [Web Authentication API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) is the result of a WebAuthn credential registration. It contains information about the credential that the server needs to perform WebAuthn assertions, such as its credential ID and public key.

An `AuthenticatorAttestationResponse` object instance is available in the [response](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential/response) property of a [PublicKeyCredential](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredential) object returned by a successful [CredentialsContainer.create()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create) call.

This interface inherits from [AuthenticatorResponse](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorResponse).

Note: This interface is restricted to top-level contexts. Use of its features from within an [<iframe>](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe) element will not have any effect.

## [Instance properties](#instance_properties)

Also inherits properties from its parent, [AuthenticatorResponse](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorResponse).

[AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.attestationObject](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/attestationObject)Read only

An [ArrayBuffer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) containing authenticator data and an attestation statement for a new key pair generated by the authenticator.

[AuthenticatorResponse.clientDataJSON](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorResponse/clientDataJSON)Read only

Inherited from [AuthenticatorResponse](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorResponse), this property contains the JSON-compatible serialization of the data passed from the browser to the authenticator in order to generate this credential — i.e., when [CredentialsContainer.create()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create) is called with a `publicKey` option. This data contains some information from the options passed into the `create()` call, and some information controlled by the browser.

## [Instance methods](#instance_methods)

[AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.getAuthenticatorData()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/getAuthenticatorData)

Returns an [ArrayBuffer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) containing the authenticator data contained within the [AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.attestationObject](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/attestationObject) property.

[AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.getPublicKey()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/getPublicKey)

Returns an [ArrayBuffer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) containing the DER `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` of the new credential (see [Subject Public Key Info](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.7)), or `null` if this is not available.

[AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.getPublicKeyAlgorithm()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/getPublicKeyAlgorithm)

Returns a number that is equal to a [COSE Algorithm Identifier](https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms), representing the cryptographic algorithm used for the new credential.

[AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.getTransports()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/getTransports)

Returns an array of strings describing which transport methods (e.g., `usb`, `nfc`) are believed to be supported with the authenticator. The array may be empty if the information is not available.

## [Examples](#examples)

See [Creating a public key credential](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create#creating_a_public_key_credential) for a detailed example.
