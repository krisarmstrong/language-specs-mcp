# WCAG H37: Require images to have alternative text

Rule ID:wcag/h37Category:AccessibilityStandards:

- WCAG 2.2 (A)
- WCAG 2.1 (A)
- WCAG 2.0 (A)

Both [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#alt) and [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H37) requires all images to have an alternative text. Assistive technology such as screenreaders relies on the alt-text to provide a description of the image.

Purely Decorative images must use empty (`null`) `alt=""` attribute (preferred) or be excluded from accessibility tree with `role="presentation"` or `aria-hidden="true"`.

See [wcag/h36](h36.html) for a similar rule for `<input type="image">`.

## [Rule details](#rule-details)

Examples of incorrect code for this rule:

```
<img>
```

```
error: <img> is missing required "alt" attribute (wcag/h37) at inline:1:2:
> 1 | <img>
    |  ^^^

1 error found.
```

Examples of correct code for this rule:

```
<img alt="...">
```

## [Options](#options)

This rule takes an optional object:

```
{
  "allowEmpty": true,
  "alias": []
}
```

### [allowEmpty](#allowempty)

Sometimes images are used in context where the image only adds to the user experience but is already clear from an A11Y perspective.

When `true` this allows empty `<img alt="">` to be used to prevent errors and to signal that the image is not meant to be read.

Examples of correct code with this option enabled:

```
<span>The task was successfully completed! <img src="thumbsup.png" alt=""></span>
```

### [alias](#alias)

If javascript is used to set the attribute on-the-fly (e.g. using `angular-translate`) the alternative attributes can be listed here.

Examples of correct code when `alias` is `["data-alt"]`:

```
<img data-alt="...">
```
