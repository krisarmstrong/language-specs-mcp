# WCAG H30: Providing link text

Rule ID:wcag/h30Category:AccessibilityStandards:

- WCAG 2.2 (A)
- WCAG 2.1 (A)
- WCAG 2.0 (A)

[WCAG H30](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H30) requires each `<a href>` anchor link to have a text describing the purpose of the text. The description may come from plain text or from an image with alternative text.

The purpose of this rule is to ensure users can distinguish the link from other links and determine whenever to follow the link or not. Assistive technology may also present a list of links in which case the description is the only thing the user will be presented with.

Links can be excluded from the accessibility tree with `aria-hidden="true"`.

The rule recognizes the following patterns:

- Text (non-whitespace) inside the link
- Images with `alt` text (non-whitespace)
- `aria-label` either on the link or at least one descendant.
- `aria-hidden` on the link
- `<svg>` with `<title>` or `<desc>`
