package httptest // import "net/http/httptest"

Package httptest provides utilities for HTTP testing.

CONSTANTS

const DefaultRemoteAddr = "1.2.3.4"
    DefaultRemoteAddr is the default remote address to return in RemoteAddr if
    an explicit DefaultRemoteAddr isn't set on ResponseRecorder.


FUNCTIONS

func NewRequest(method, target string, body io.Reader) *http.Request
    NewRequest wraps NewRequestWithContext using context.Background.

func NewRequestWithContext(ctx context.Context, method, target string, body io.Reader) *http.Request
    NewRequestWithContext returns a new incoming server Request, suitable for
    passing to an http.Handler for testing.

    The target is the RFC 7230 "request-target": it may be either a path or an
    absolute URL. If target is an absolute URL, the host name from the URL is
    used. Otherwise, "example.com" is used.

    The TLS field is set to a non-nil dummy value if target has scheme "https".

    The Request.Proto is always HTTP/1.1.

    An empty method means "GET".

    The provided body may be nil. If the body is of type bytes.Reader,
    strings.Reader, bytes.Buffer, or the value http.NoBody, the
    Request.ContentLength is set.

    NewRequest panics on error for ease of use in testing, where a panic is
    acceptable.

    To generate a client HTTP request instead of a server request, see the
    NewRequest function in the net/http package.


TYPES

type ResponseRecorder struct {
	// Code is the HTTP response code set by WriteHeader.
	//
	// Note that if a Handler never calls WriteHeader or Write,
	// this might end up being 0, rather than the implicit
	// http.StatusOK. To get the implicit value, use the Result
	// method.
	Code int

	// HeaderMap contains the headers explicitly set by the Handler.
	// It is an internal detail.
	//
	// Deprecated: HeaderMap exists for historical compatibility
	// and should not be used. To access the headers returned by a handler,
	// use the Response.Header map as returned by the Result method.
	HeaderMap http.Header

	// Body is the buffer to which the Handler's Write calls are sent.
	// If nil, the Writes are silently discarded.
	Body *bytes.Buffer

	// Flushed is whether the Handler called Flush.
	Flushed bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ResponseRecorder is an implementation of http.ResponseWriter that records
    its mutations for later inspection in tests.

func NewRecorder() *ResponseRecorder
    NewRecorder returns an initialized ResponseRecorder.

func (rw *ResponseRecorder) Flush()
    Flush implements http.Flusher. To test whether Flush was called, see
    rw.Flushed.

func (rw *ResponseRecorder) Header() http.Header
    Header implements http.ResponseWriter. It returns the response headers
    to mutate within a handler. To test the headers that were written after
    a handler completes, use the ResponseRecorder.Result method and see the
    returned Response value's Header.

func (rw *ResponseRecorder) Result() *http.Response
    Result returns the response generated by the handler.

    The returned Response will have at least its StatusCode, Header, Body, and
    optionally Trailer populated. More fields may be populated in the future,
    so callers should not DeepEqual the result in tests.

    The Response.Header is a snapshot of the headers at the time of the first
    write call, or at the time of this call, if the handler never did a write.

    The Response.Body is guaranteed to be non-nil and Body.Read call is
    guaranteed to not return any error other than io.EOF.

    Result must only be called after the handler has finished running.

func (rw *ResponseRecorder) Write(buf []byte) (int, error)
    Write implements http.ResponseWriter. The data in buf is written to rw.Body,
    if not nil.

func (rw *ResponseRecorder) WriteHeader(code int)
    WriteHeader implements http.ResponseWriter.

func (rw *ResponseRecorder) WriteString(str string) (int, error)
    WriteString implements io.StringWriter. The data in str is written to
    rw.Body, if not nil.

type Server struct {
	URL      string // base URL of form http://ipaddr:port with no trailing slash
	Listener net.Listener

	// EnableHTTP2 controls whether HTTP/2 is enabled
	// on the server. It must be set between calling
	// NewUnstartedServer and calling Server.StartTLS.
	EnableHTTP2 bool

	// TLS is the optional TLS configuration, populated with a new config
	// after TLS is started. If set on an unstarted server before StartTLS
	// is called, existing fields are copied into the new config.
	TLS *tls.Config

	// Config may be changed after calling NewUnstartedServer and
	// before Start or StartTLS.
	Config *http.Server

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Server is an HTTP server listening on a system-chosen port on the local
    loopback interface, for use in end-to-end HTTP tests.

func NewServer(handler http.Handler) *Server
    NewServer starts and returns a new Server. The caller should call Close when
    finished, to shut it down.

func NewTLSServer(handler http.Handler) *Server
    NewTLSServer starts and returns a new Server using TLS. The caller should
    call Close when finished, to shut it down.

func NewUnstartedServer(handler http.Handler) *Server
    NewUnstartedServer returns a new Server but doesn't start it.

    After changing its configuration, the caller should call Start or StartTLS.

    The caller should call Close when finished, to shut it down.

func (s *Server) Certificate() *x509.Certificate
    Certificate returns the certificate used by the server, or nil if the server
    doesn't use TLS.

func (s *Server) Client() *http.Client
    Client returns an HTTP client configured for making requests to the server.
    It is configured to trust the server's TLS test certificate and will close
    its idle connections on Server.Close. Use Server.URL as the base URL to send
    requests to the server.

func (s *Server) Close()
    Close shuts down the server and blocks until all outstanding requests on
    this server have completed.

func (s *Server) CloseClientConnections()
    CloseClientConnections closes any open HTTP connections to the test Server.

func (s *Server) Start()
    Start starts a server from NewUnstartedServer.

func (s *Server) StartTLS()
    StartTLS starts TLS on a server from NewUnstartedServer.
