package fstest // import "testing/fstest"

Package fstest implements support for testing implementations and users of file
systems.

FUNCTIONS

func TestFS(fsys fs.FS, expected ...string) error
    TestFS tests a file system implementation. It walks the entire tree of
    files in fsys, opening and checking that each file behaves correctly.
    Symbolic links are not followed, but their Lstat values are checked if the
    file system implements fs.ReadLinkFS. It also checks that the file system
    contains at least the expected files. As a special case, if no expected
    files are listed, fsys must be empty. Otherwise, fsys must contain at least
    the listed files; it can also contain others. The contents of fsys must not
    change concurrently with TestFS.

    If TestFS finds any misbehaviors, it returns either the first error or a
    list of errors. Use errors.Is or errors.As to inspect.

    Typical usage inside a test is:

        if err := fstest.TestFS(myFS, "file/that/should/be/present"); err != nil {
        	t.Fatal(err)
        }


TYPES

type MapFS map[string]*MapFile
    A MapFS is a simple in-memory file system for use in tests, represented as
    a map from path names (arguments to Open) to information about the files,
    directories, or symbolic links they represent.

    The map need not include parent directories for files contained in the map;
    those will be synthesized if needed. But a directory can still be included
    by setting the [MapFile.Mode]'s fs.ModeDir bit; this may be necessary for
    detailed control over the directory's fs.FileInfo or to create an empty
    directory.

    File system operations read directly from the map, so that the file system
    can be changed by editing the map as needed. An implication is that file
    system operations must not run concurrently with changes to the map, which
    would be a race. Another implication is that opening or reading a directory
    requires iterating over the entire map, so a MapFS should typically be used
    with not more than a few hundred entries or directory reads.

func (fsys MapFS) Glob(pattern string) ([]string, error)

func (fsys MapFS) Lstat(name string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
    Lstat returns a FileInfo describing the named file. If the file is a
    symbolic link, the returned FileInfo describes the symbolic link. Lstat
    makes no attempt to follow the link.

func (fsys MapFS) Open(name string) (fs.File, error)
    Open opens the named file after following any symbolic links.

func (fsys MapFS) ReadDir(name string) ([]fs.DirEntry, error)

func (fsys MapFS) ReadFile(name string) ([]byte, error)

func (fsys MapFS) ReadLink(name string) (string, error)
    ReadLink returns the destination of the named symbolic link.

func (fsys MapFS) Stat(name string) (fs.FileInfo, error)

func (fsys MapFS) Sub(dir string) (fs.FS, error)

type MapFile struct {
	Data    []byte      // file content or symlink destination
	Mode    fs.FileMode // fs.FileInfo.Mode
	ModTime time.Time   // fs.FileInfo.ModTime
	Sys     any         // fs.FileInfo.Sys
}
    A MapFile describes a single file in a MapFS.
