FUNCTIONS

func DumpRequest(req *http.Request, body bool) ([]byte, error)
    DumpRequest returns the given request in its HTTP/1.x wire representation.
    It should only be used by servers to debug client requests. The returned
    representation is an approximation only; some details of the initial request
    are lost while parsing it into an http.Request. In particular, the order and
    case of header field names are lost. The order of values in multi-valued
    headers is kept intact. HTTP/2 requests are dumped in HTTP/1.x form,
    not in their original binary representations.

    If body is true, DumpRequest also returns the body. To do so, it consumes
    req.Body and then replaces it with a new io.ReadCloser that yields the same
    bytes. If DumpRequest returns an error, the state of req is undefined.

    The documentation for http.Request.Write details which fields of req are
    included in the dump.

func DumpRequestOut(req *http.Request, body bool) ([]byte, error)
    DumpRequestOut is like DumpRequest but for outgoing client requests.
    It includes any headers that the standard http.Transport adds, such as
    User-Agent.

func DumpResponse(resp *http.Response, body bool) ([]byte, error)
    DumpResponse is like DumpRequest but dumps a response.

func NewChunkedReader(r io.Reader) io.Reader
    NewChunkedReader returns a new chunkedReader that translates the data read
    from r out of HTTP "chunked" format before returning it. The chunkedReader
    returns io.EOF when the final 0-length chunk is read.

    NewChunkedReader is not needed by normal applications. The http package
    automatically decodes chunking when reading response bodies.

func NewChunkedWriter(w io.Writer) io.WriteCloser
    NewChunkedWriter returns a new chunkedWriter that translates writes into
    HTTP "chunked" format before writing them to w. Closing the returned
    chunkedWriter sends the final 0-length chunk that marks the end of the
    stream but does not send the final CRLF that appears after trailers;
    trailers and the last CRLF must be written separately.

    NewChunkedWriter is not needed by normal applications. The http package
    adds chunking automatically if handlers don't set a Content-Length header.
    Using NewChunkedWriter inside a handler would result in double chunking or
    chunking with a Content-Length length, both of which are wrong.


TYPES

type BufferPool interface {
	Get() []byte
	Put([]byte)
}
    A BufferPool is an interface for getting and returning temporary byte slices
    for use by io.CopyBuffer.

type ClientConn struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ClientConn is an artifact of Go's early HTTP implementation. It is
    low-level, old, and unused by Go's current HTTP stack. We should have
    deleted it before Go 1.

    Deprecated: Use Client or Transport in package net/http instead.

func NewClientConn(c net.Conn, r *bufio.Reader) *ClientConn
    NewClientConn is an artifact of Go's early HTTP implementation. It is
    low-level, old, and unused by Go's current HTTP stack. We should have
    deleted it before Go 1.

    Deprecated: Use the Client or Transport in package net/http instead.

func NewProxyClientConn(c net.Conn, r *bufio.Reader) *ClientConn
    NewProxyClientConn is an artifact of Go's early HTTP implementation.
    It is low-level, old, and unused by Go's current HTTP stack. We should have
    deleted it before Go 1.

    Deprecated: Use the Client or Transport in package net/http instead.

func (cc *ClientConn) Close() error
    Close calls ClientConn.Hijack and then also closes the underlying
    connection.

func (cc *ClientConn) Do(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error)
    Do is convenience method that writes a request and reads a response.

func (cc *ClientConn) Hijack() (c net.Conn, r *bufio.Reader)
    Hijack detaches the ClientConn and returns the underlying connection
    as well as the read-side bufio which may have some left over data.
    Hijack may be called before the user or Read have signaled the end of the
    keep-alive logic. The user should not call Hijack while ClientConn.Read or
    ClientConn.Write is in progress.

func (cc *ClientConn) Pending() int
    Pending returns the number of unanswered requests that have been sent on the
    connection.

func (cc *ClientConn) Read(req *http.Request) (resp *http.Response, err error)
    Read reads the next response from the wire. A valid response might be
    returned together with an ErrPersistEOF, which means that the remote
    requested that this be the last request serviced. Read can be called
    concurrently with ClientConn.Write, but not with another Read.

func (cc *ClientConn) Write(req *http.Request) error
    Write writes a request. An ErrPersistEOF error is returned if the connection
    has been closed in an HTTP keep-alive sense. If req.Close equals true,
    the keep-alive connection is logically closed after this request and the
    opposing server is informed. An ErrUnexpectedEOF indicates the remote closed
    the underlying TCP connection, which is usually considered as graceful
    close.

type ProxyRequest struct {
	// In is the request received by the proxy.
	// The Rewrite function must not modify In.
	In *http.Request

	// Out is the request which will be sent by the proxy.
	// The Rewrite function may modify or replace this request.
	// Hop-by-hop headers are removed from this request
	// before Rewrite is called.
	Out *http.Request
}
    A ProxyRequest contains a request to be rewritten by a ReverseProxy.

func (r *ProxyRequest) SetURL(target *url.URL)
    SetURL routes the outbound request to the scheme, host, and base path
    provided in target. If the target's path is "/base" and the incoming
    request was for "/dir", the target request will be for "/base/dir". To route
    requests without joining the incoming path, set r.Out.URL directly.

    SetURL rewrites the outbound Host header to match the target's host.
    To preserve the inbound request's Host header (the default behavior of
    NewSingleHostReverseProxy):

        rewriteFunc := func(r *httputil.ProxyRequest) {
        	r.SetURL(url)
        	r.Out.Host = r.In.Host
        }

func (r *ProxyRequest) SetXForwarded()
    SetXForwarded sets the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and
    X-Forwarded-Proto headers of the outbound request.

      - The X-Forwarded-For header is set to the client IP address.
      - The X-Forwarded-Host header is set to the host name requested by the
        client.
      - The X-Forwarded-Proto header is set to "http" or "https", depending on
        whether the inbound request was made on a TLS-enabled connection.

    If the outbound request contains an existing X-Forwarded-For header,
    SetXForwarded appends the client IP address to it. To append to the inbound
    request's X-Forwarded-For header (the default behavior of ReverseProxy when
    using a Director function), copy the header from the inbound request before
    calling SetXForwarded:

        rewriteFunc := func(r *httputil.ProxyRequest) {
        	r.Out.Header["X-Forwarded-For"] = r.In.Header["X-Forwarded-For"]
        	r.SetXForwarded()
        }

type ReverseProxy struct {
	// Rewrite must be a function which modifies
	// the request into a new request to be sent
	// using Transport. Its response is then copied
	// back to the original client unmodified.
	// Rewrite must not access the provided ProxyRequest
	// or its contents after returning.
	//
	// The Forwarded, X-Forwarded, X-Forwarded-Host,
	// and X-Forwarded-Proto headers are removed from the
	// outbound request before Rewrite is called. See also
	// the ProxyRequest.SetXForwarded method.
	//
	// Unparsable query parameters are removed from the
	// outbound request before Rewrite is called.
	// The Rewrite function may copy the inbound URL's
	// RawQuery to the outbound URL to preserve the original
	// parameter string. Note that this can lead to security
	// issues if the proxy's interpretation of query parameters
	// does not match that of the downstream server.
	//
	// At most one of Rewrite or Director may be set.
	Rewrite func(*ProxyRequest)

	// Director is a function which modifies
	// the request into a new request to be sent
	// using Transport. Its response is then copied
	// back to the original client unmodified.
	// Director must not access the provided Request
	// after returning.
	//
	// By default, the X-Forwarded-For header is set to the
	// value of the client IP address. If an X-Forwarded-For
	// header already exists, the client IP is appended to the
	// existing values. As a special case, if the header
	// exists in the Request.Header map but has a nil value
	// (such as when set by the Director func), the X-Forwarded-For
	// header is not modified.
	//
	// To prevent IP spoofing, be sure to delete any pre-existing
	// X-Forwarded-For header coming from the client or
	// an untrusted proxy.
	//
	// Hop-by-hop headers are removed from the request after
	// Director returns, which can remove headers added by
	// Director. Use a Rewrite function instead to ensure
	// modifications to the request are preserved.
	//
	// Unparsable query parameters are removed from the outbound
	// request if Request.Form is set after Director returns.
	//
	// At most one of Rewrite or Director may be set.
	Director func(*http.Request)

	// The transport used to perform proxy requests.
	// If nil, http.DefaultTransport is used.
	Transport http.RoundTripper

	// FlushInterval specifies the flush interval
	// to flush to the client while copying the
	// response body.
	// If zero, no periodic flushing is done.
	// A negative value means to flush immediately
	// after each write to the client.
	// The FlushInterval is ignored when ReverseProxy
	// recognizes a response as a streaming response, or
	// if its ContentLength is -1; for such responses, writes
	// are flushed to the client immediately.
	FlushInterval time.Duration

	// ErrorLog specifies an optional logger for errors
	// that occur when attempting to proxy the request.
	// If nil, logging is done via the log package's standard logger.
	ErrorLog *log.Logger

	// BufferPool optionally specifies a buffer pool to
	// get byte slices for use by io.CopyBuffer when
	// copying HTTP response bodies.
	BufferPool BufferPool

	// ModifyResponse is an optional function that modifies the
	// Response from the backend. It is called if the backend
	// returns a response at all, with any HTTP status code.
	// If the backend is unreachable, the optional ErrorHandler is
	// called without any call to ModifyResponse.
	//
	// Hop-by-hop headers are removed from the response before
	// calling ModifyResponse. ModifyResponse may need to remove
	// additional headers to fit its deployment model, such as Alt-Svc.
	//
	// If ModifyResponse returns an error, ErrorHandler is called
	// with its error value. If ErrorHandler is nil, its default
	// implementation is used.
	ModifyResponse func(*http.Response) error

	// ErrorHandler is an optional function that handles errors
	// reaching the backend or errors from ModifyResponse.
	//
	// If nil, the default is to log the provided error and return
	// a 502 Status Bad Gateway response.
	ErrorHandler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, error)
}
    ReverseProxy is an HTTP Handler that takes an incoming request and sends it
    to another server, proxying the response back to the client.

    1xx responses are forwarded to the client if the underlying transport
    supports ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse.

    Hop-by-hop headers (see RFC 9110, section 7.6.1), including Connection,
    Proxy-Connection, Keep-Alive, Proxy-Authenticate, Proxy-Authorization, TE,
    Trailer, Transfer-Encoding, and Upgrade, are removed from client requests
    and backend responses. The Rewrite function may be used to add hop-by-hop
    headers to the request, and the ModifyResponse function may be used to
    remove them from the response.

func NewSingleHostReverseProxy(target *url.URL) *ReverseProxy
    NewSingleHostReverseProxy returns a new ReverseProxy that routes URLs to
    the scheme, host, and base path provided in target. If the target's path is
    "/base" and the incoming request was for "/dir", the target request will be
    for /base/dir.

    NewSingleHostReverseProxy does not rewrite the Host header.

    To customize the ReverseProxy behavior beyond what NewSingleHostReverseProxy
    provides, use ReverseProxy directly with a Rewrite function. The
    ProxyRequest SetURL method may be used to route the outbound request. (Note
    that SetURL, unlike NewSingleHostReverseProxy, rewrites the Host header of
    the outbound request by default.)

        proxy := &ReverseProxy{
        	Rewrite: func(r *ProxyRequest) {
        		r.SetURL(target)
        		r.Out.Host = r.In.Host // if desired
        	},
        }

func (p *ReverseProxy) ServeHTTP(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request)

type ServerConn struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ServerConn is an artifact of Go's early HTTP implementation. It is
    low-level, old, and unused by Go's current HTTP stack. We should have
    deleted it before Go 1.

    Deprecated: Use the Server in package net/http instead.

func NewServerConn(c net.Conn, r *bufio.Reader) *ServerConn
    NewServerConn is an artifact of Go's early HTTP implementation. It is
    low-level, old, and unused by Go's current HTTP stack. We should have
    deleted it before Go 1.

    Deprecated: Use the Server in package net/http instead.

func (sc *ServerConn) Close() error
    Close calls ServerConn.Hijack and then also closes the underlying
    connection.

func (sc *ServerConn) Hijack() (net.Conn, *bufio.Reader)
    Hijack detaches the ServerConn and returns the underlying connection as
    well as the read-side bufio which may have some left over data. Hijack
    may be called before Read has signaled the end of the keep-alive logic.
    The user should not call Hijack while ServerConn.Read or ServerConn.Write is
    in progress.

func (sc *ServerConn) Pending() int
    Pending returns the number of unanswered requests that have been received on
    the connection.

func (sc *ServerConn) Read() (*http.Request, error)
    Read returns the next request on the wire. An ErrPersistEOF is returned if
    it is gracefully determined that there are no more requests (e.g. after the
    first request on an HTTP/1.0 connection, or after a Connection:close on a
    HTTP/1.1 connection).

func (sc *ServerConn) Write(req *http.Request, resp *http.Response) error
    Write writes resp in response to req. To close the connection gracefully,
    set the Response.Close field to true. Write should be considered operational
    until it returns an error, regardless of any errors returned on the
    ServerConn.Read side.
