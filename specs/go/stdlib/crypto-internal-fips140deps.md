package fipsdeps // import "crypto/internal/fips140deps"

Package fipsdeps contains wrapper packages for internal APIs that are exposed
to the FIPS module. Since modules are frozen upon validation and supported for
a number of future versions, APIs exposed by crypto/internal/fips140deps/...
must not be changed until the modules that use them are no longer supported.
