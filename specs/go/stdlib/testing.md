package testing // import "testing"

Package testing provides support for automated testing of Go packages.
It is intended to be used in concert with the "go test" command, which automates
execution of any function of the form

    func TestXxx(*testing.T)

where Xxx does not start with a lowercase letter. The function name serves to
identify the test routine.

Within these functions, use T.Error, T.Fail or related methods to signal
failure.

To write a new test suite, create a file that contains the TestXxx functions as
described here, and give that file a name ending in "_test.go". The file will
be excluded from regular package builds but will be included when the "go test"
command is run.

The test file can be in the same package as the one being tested, or in a
corresponding package with the suffix "_test".

If the test file is in the same package, it may refer to unexported identifiers
within the package, as in this example:

    package abs

    import "testing"

    func TestAbs(t *testing.T) {
        got := Abs(-1)
        if got != 1 {
            t.Errorf("Abs(-1) = %d; want 1", got)
        }
    }

If the file is in a separate "_test" package, the package being tested must be
imported explicitly and only its exported identifiers may be used. This is known
as "black box" testing.

    package abs_test

    import (
    	"testing"

    	"path_to_pkg/abs"
    )

    func TestAbs(t *testing.T) {
        got := abs.Abs(-1)
        if got != 1 {
            t.Errorf("Abs(-1) = %d; want 1", got)
        }
    }

For more detail, run go help test and go help testflag.

# Benchmarks

Functions of the form

    func BenchmarkXxx(*testing.B)

are considered benchmarks, and are executed by the "go test" command when its
-bench flag is provided. Benchmarks are run sequentially.

For a description of the testing flags, see go help testflag.

A sample benchmark function looks like this:

    func BenchmarkRandInt(b *testing.B) {
        for b.Loop() {
            rand.Int()
        }
    }

The output

    BenchmarkRandInt-8   	68453040	        17.8 ns/op

means that the body of the loop ran 68453040 times at a speed of 17.8 ns per
loop.

Only the body of the loop is timed, so benchmarks may do expensive setup before
calling b.Loop, which will not be counted toward the benchmark measurement:

    func BenchmarkBigLen(b *testing.B) {
        big := NewBig()
        for b.Loop() {
            big.Len()
        }
    }

If a benchmark needs to test performance in a parallel setting, it may use the
RunParallel helper function; such benchmarks are intended to be used with the go
test -cpu flag:

    func BenchmarkTemplateParallel(b *testing.B) {
        templ := template.Must(template.New("test").Parse("Hello, {{.}}!"))
        b.RunParallel(func(pb *testing.PB) {
            var buf bytes.Buffer
            for pb.Next() {
                buf.Reset()
                templ.Execute(&buf, "World")
            }
        })
    }

A detailed specification of the benchmark results format is given in
https://go.dev/design/14313-benchmark-format.

There are standard tools for working with benchmark results at
golang.org/x/perf/cmd. In particular, golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat performs
statistically robust A/B comparisons.

# b.N-style benchmarks

Prior to the introduction of B.Loop, benchmarks were written in a different
style using B.N. For example:

    func BenchmarkRandInt(b *testing.B) {
        for range b.N {
            rand.Int()
        }
    }

In this style of benchmark, the benchmark function must run the target code b.N
times. The benchmark function is called multiple times with b.N adjusted until
the benchmark function lasts long enough to be timed reliably. This also means
any setup done before the loop may be run several times.

If a benchmark needs some expensive setup before running, the timer should be
explicitly reset:

    func BenchmarkBigLen(b *testing.B) {
        big := NewBig()
        b.ResetTimer()
        for range b.N {
            big.Len()
        }
    }

New benchmarks should prefer using B.Loop, which is more robust and more
efficient.

# Examples

The package also runs and verifies example code. Example functions may include
a concluding line comment that begins with "Output:" and is compared with the
standard output of the function when the tests are run. (The comparison ignores
leading and trailing space.) These are examples of an example:

    func ExampleHello() {
        fmt.Println("hello")
        // Output: hello
    }

    func ExampleSalutations() {
        fmt.Println("hello, and")
        fmt.Println("goodbye")
        // Output:
        // hello, and
        // goodbye
    }

The comment prefix "Unordered output:" is like "Output:", but matches any line
order:

    func ExamplePerm() {
        for _, value := range Perm(5) {
            fmt.Println(value)
        }
        // Unordered output: 4
        // 2
        // 1
        // 3
        // 0
    }

Example functions without output comments are compiled but not executed.

The naming convention to declare examples for the package, a function F,
a type T and method M on type T are:

    func Example() { ... }
    func ExampleF() { ... }
    func ExampleT() { ... }
    func ExampleT_M() { ... }

Multiple example functions for a package/type/function/method may be provided by
appending a distinct suffix to the name. The suffix must start with a lower-case
letter.

    func Example_suffix() { ... }
    func ExampleF_suffix() { ... }
    func ExampleT_suffix() { ... }
    func ExampleT_M_suffix() { ... }

The entire test file is presented as the example when it contains a single
example function, at least one other function, type, variable, or constant
declaration, and no test or benchmark functions.

# Fuzzing

'go test' and the testing package support fuzzing, a testing technique where a
function is called with randomly generated inputs to find bugs not anticipated
by unit tests.

Functions of the form

    func FuzzXxx(*testing.F)

are considered fuzz tests.

For example:

    func FuzzHex(f *testing.F) {
      for _, seed := range [][]byte{{}, {0}, {9}, {0xa}, {0xf}, {1, 2, 3, 4}} {
        f.Add(seed)
      }
      f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, in []byte) {
        enc := hex.EncodeToString(in)
        out, err := hex.DecodeString(enc)
        if err != nil {
          t.Fatalf("%v: decode: %v", in, err)
        }
        if !bytes.Equal(in, out) {
          t.Fatalf("%v: not equal after round trip: %v", in, out)
        }
      })
    }

A fuzz test maintains a seed corpus, or a set of inputs which are run by
default, and can seed input generation. Seed inputs may be registered by calling
F.Add or by storing files in the directory testdata/fuzz/<Name> (where <Name>
is the name of the fuzz test) within the package containing the fuzz test. Seed
inputs are optional, but the fuzzing engine may find bugs more efficiently when
provided with a set of small seed inputs with good code coverage. These seed
inputs can also serve as regression tests for bugs identified through fuzzing.

The function passed to F.Fuzz within the fuzz test is considered the fuzz
target. A fuzz target must accept a *T parameter, followed by one or more
parameters for random inputs. The types of arguments passed to F.Add must be
identical to the types of these parameters. The fuzz target may signal that it's
found a problem the same way tests do: by calling T.Fail (or any method that
calls it like T.Error or T.Fatal) or by panicking.

When fuzzing is enabled (by setting the -fuzz flag to a regular expression
that matches a specific fuzz test), the fuzz target is called with arguments
generated by repeatedly making random changes to the seed inputs. On supported
platforms, 'go test' compiles the test executable with fuzzing coverage
instrumentation. The fuzzing engine uses that instrumentation to find and
cache inputs that expand coverage, increasing the likelihood of finding bugs.
If the fuzz target fails for a given input, the fuzzing engine writes the inputs
that caused the failure to a file in the directory testdata/fuzz/<Name> within
the package directory. This file later serves as a seed input. If the file can't
be written at that location (for example, because the directory is read-only),
the fuzzing engine writes the file to the fuzz cache directory within the build
cache instead.

When fuzzing is disabled, the fuzz target is called with the seed inputs
registered with F.Add and seed inputs from testdata/fuzz/<Name>. In this mode,
the fuzz test acts much like a regular test, with subtests started with F.Fuzz
instead of T.Run.

See https://go.dev/doc/fuzz for documentation about fuzzing.

# Skipping

Tests or benchmarks may be skipped at run time with a call to T.Skip or B.Skip:

    func TestTimeConsuming(t *testing.T) {
        if testing.Short() {
            t.Skip("skipping test in short mode.")
        }
        ...
    }

The T.Skip method can be used in a fuzz target if the input is invalid,
but should not be considered a failing input. For example:

    func FuzzJSONMarshaling(f *testing.F) {
        f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, b []byte) {
            var v interface{}
            if err := json.Unmarshal(b, &v); err != nil {
                t.Skip()
            }
            if _, err := json.Marshal(v); err != nil {
                t.Errorf("Marshal: %v", err)
            }
        })
    }

# Subtests and Sub-benchmarks

The T.Run and B.Run methods allow defining subtests and sub-benchmarks,
without having to define separate functions for each. This enables uses like
table-driven benchmarks and creating hierarchical tests. It also provides a way
to share common setup and tear-down code:

    func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
        // <setup code>
        t.Run("A=1", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
        t.Run("A=2", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
        t.Run("B=1", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
        // <tear-down code>
    }

Each subtest and sub-benchmark has a unique name: the combination of the name
of the top-level test and the sequence of names passed to Run, separated by
slashes, with an optional trailing sequence number for disambiguation.

The argument to the -run, -bench, and -fuzz command-line flags is an
unanchored regular expression that matches the test's name. For tests with
multiple slash-separated elements, such as subtests, the argument is itself
slash-separated, with expressions matching each name element in turn.
Because it is unanchored, an empty expression matches any string. For example,
using "matching" to mean "whose name contains":

    go test -run ''        # Run all tests.
    go test -run Foo       # Run top-level tests matching "Foo", such as "TestFooBar".
    go test -run Foo/A=    # For top-level tests matching "Foo", run subtests matching "A=".
    go test -run /A=1      # For all top-level tests, run subtests matching "A=1".
    go test -fuzz FuzzFoo  # Fuzz the target matching "FuzzFoo"

The -run argument can also be used to run a specific value in the seed corpus,
for debugging. For example:

    go test -run=FuzzFoo/9ddb952d9814

The -fuzz and -run flags can both be set, in order to fuzz a target but skip the
execution of all other tests.

Subtests can also be used to control parallelism. A parent test will only
complete once all of its subtests complete. In this example, all tests are
run in parallel with each other, and only with each other, regardless of other
top-level tests that may be defined:

    func TestGroupedParallel(t *testing.T) {
        for _, tc := range tests {
            t.Run(tc.Name, func(t *testing.T) {
                t.Parallel()
                ...
            })
        }
    }

Run does not return until parallel subtests have completed, providing a way to
clean up after a group of parallel tests:

    func TestTeardownParallel(t *testing.T) {
        // This Run will not return until the parallel tests finish.
        t.Run("group", func(t *testing.T) {
            t.Run("Test1", parallelTest1)
            t.Run("Test2", parallelTest2)
            t.Run("Test3", parallelTest3)
        })
        // <tear-down code>
    }

# Main

It is sometimes necessary for a test or benchmark program to do extra setup or
teardown before or after it executes. It is also sometimes necessary to control
which code runs on the main thread. To support these and other cases, if a test
file contains a function:

    func TestMain(m *testing.M)

then the generated test will call TestMain(m) instead of running the tests or
benchmarks directly. TestMain runs in the main goroutine and can do whatever
setup and teardown is necessary around a call to m.Run. m.Run will return an
exit code that may be passed to os.Exit. If TestMain returns, the test wrapper
will pass the result of m.Run to os.Exit itself.

When TestMain is called, flag.Parse has not been run. If TestMain depends on
command-line flags, including those of the testing package, it should call
flag.Parse explicitly. Command line flags are always parsed by the time test or
benchmark functions run.

A simple implementation of TestMain is:

    func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
    	// call flag.Parse() here if TestMain uses flags
    	m.Run()
    }

TestMain is a low-level primitive and should not be necessary for casual testing
needs, where ordinary test functions suffice.

FUNCTIONS

func AllocsPerRun(runs int, f func()) (avg float64)
    AllocsPerRun returns the average number of allocations during calls to f.
    Although the return value has type float64, it will always be an integral
    value.

    To compute the number of allocations, the function will first be run once
    as a warm-up. The average number of allocations over the specified number of
    runs will then be measured and returned.

    AllocsPerRun sets runtime.GOMAXPROCS to 1 during its measurement and will
    restore it before returning.

func CoverMode() string
    CoverMode reports what the test coverage mode is set to. The values are
    "set", "count", or "atomic". The return value will be empty if test coverage
    is not enabled.

func Coverage() float64
    Coverage reports the current code coverage as a fraction in the range [0,
    1]. If coverage is not enabled, Coverage returns 0.

    When running a large set of sequential test cases, checking Coverage after
    each one can be useful for identifying which test cases exercise new code
    paths. It is not a replacement for the reports generated by 'go test -cover'
    and 'go tool cover'.

func Init()
    Init registers testing flags. These flags are automatically registered by
    the "go test" command before running test functions, so Init is only needed
    when calling functions such as Benchmark without using "go test".

    Init is not safe to call concurrently. It has no effect if it was already
    called.

func Main(matchString func(pat, str string) (bool, error), tests []InternalTest, benchmarks []InternalBenchmark, examples []InternalExample)
    Main is an internal function, part of the implementation of the "go test"
    command. It was exported because it is cross-package and predates "internal"
    packages. It is no longer used by "go test" but preserved, as much as
    possible, for other systems that simulate "go test" using Main, but Main
    sometimes cannot be updated as new functionality is added to the testing
    package. Systems simulating "go test" should be updated to use MainStart.

func RegisterCover(c Cover)
    RegisterCover records the coverage data accumulators for the tests. NOTE:
    This function is internal to the testing infrastructure and may change.
    It is not covered (yet) by the Go 1 compatibility guidelines.

func RunBenchmarks(matchString func(pat, str string) (bool, error), benchmarks []InternalBenchmark)
    RunBenchmarks is an internal function but exported because it is
    cross-package; it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

func RunExamples(matchString func(pat, str string) (bool, error), examples []InternalExample) (ok bool)
    RunExamples is an internal function but exported because it is
    cross-package; it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

func RunTests(matchString func(pat, str string) (bool, error), tests []InternalTest) (ok bool)
    RunTests is an internal function but exported because it is cross-package;
    it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

func Short() bool
    Short reports whether the -test.short flag is set.

func Testing() bool
    Testing reports whether the current code is being run in a test. This will
    report true in programs created by "go test", false in programs created by
    "go build".

func Verbose() bool
    Verbose reports whether the -test.v flag is set.


TYPES

type B struct {
	N int

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    B is a type passed to Benchmark functions to manage benchmark timing and
    control the number of iterations.

    A benchmark ends when its Benchmark function returns or calls any of the
    methods B.FailNow, B.Fatal, B.Fatalf, B.SkipNow, B.Skip, or B.Skipf.
    Those methods must be called only from the goroutine running the Benchmark
    function. The other reporting methods, such as the variations of B.Log and
    B.Error, may be called simultaneously from multiple goroutines.

    Like in tests, benchmark logs are accumulated during execution and dumped
    to standard output when done. Unlike in tests, benchmark logs are always
    printed, so as not to hide output whose existence may be affecting benchmark
    results.

func (c *B) Attr(key, value string)
    Attr emits a test attribute associated with this test.

    The key must not contain whitespace. The value must not contain newlines or
    carriage returns.

    The meaning of different attribute keys is left up to continuous integration
    systems and test frameworks.

    Test attributes are emitted immediately in the test log, but they are
    intended to be treated as unordered.

func (c *B) Chdir(dir string)
    Chdir calls os.Chdir and uses Cleanup to restore the current working
    directory to its original value after the test. On Unix, it also sets PWD
    environment variable for the duration of the test.

    Because Chdir affects the whole process, it cannot be used in parallel tests
    or tests with parallel ancestors.

func (c *B) Cleanup(f func())
    Cleanup registers a function to be called when the test (or subtest) and
    all its subtests complete. Cleanup functions will be called in last added,
    first called order.

func (c *B) Context() context.Context
    Context returns a context that is canceled just before Cleanup-registered
    functions are called.

    Cleanup functions can wait for any resources that shut down on
    context.Context.Done before the test or benchmark completes.

func (b *B) Elapsed() time.Duration
    Elapsed returns the measured elapsed time of the benchmark. The duration
    reported by Elapsed matches the one measured by B.StartTimer, B.StopTimer,
    and B.ResetTimer.

func (c *B) Error(args ...any)
    Error is equivalent to Log followed by Fail.

func (c *B) Errorf(format string, args ...any)
    Errorf is equivalent to Logf followed by Fail.

func (c *B) Fail()
    Fail marks the function as having failed but continues execution.

func (c *B) FailNow()
    FailNow marks the function as having failed and stops its execution by
    calling runtime.Goexit (which then runs all deferred calls in the current
    goroutine). Execution will continue at the next test or benchmark. FailNow
    must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function,
    not from other goroutines created during the test. Calling FailNow does not
    stop those other goroutines.

func (c *B) Failed() bool
    Failed reports whether the function has failed.

func (c *B) Fatal(args ...any)
    Fatal is equivalent to Log followed by FailNow.

func (c *B) Fatalf(format string, args ...any)
    Fatalf is equivalent to Logf followed by FailNow.

func (c *B) Helper()
    Helper marks the calling function as a test helper function. When printing
    file and line information, that function will be skipped. Helper may be
    called simultaneously from multiple goroutines.

func (c *B) Log(args ...any)
    Log formats its arguments using default formatting, analogous to
    fmt.Println, and records the text in the error log. For tests, the text
    will be printed only if the test fails or the -test.v flag is set. For
    benchmarks, the text is always printed to avoid having performance depend
    on the value of the -test.v flag. It is an error to call Log after a test or
    benchmark returns.

func (c *B) Logf(format string, args ...any)
    Logf formats its arguments according to the format, analogous to fmt.Printf,
    and records the text in the error log. A final newline is added if not
    provided. For tests, the text will be printed only if the test fails or the
    -test.v flag is set. For benchmarks, the text is always printed to avoid
    having performance depend on the value of the -test.v flag. It is an error
    to call Logf after a test or benchmark returns.

func (b *B) Loop() bool
    Loop returns true as long as the benchmark should continue running.

    A typical benchmark is structured like:

        func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
        	... setup ...
        	for b.Loop() {
        		... code to measure ...
        	}
        	... cleanup ...
        }

    Loop resets the benchmark timer the first time it is called in a benchmark,
    so any setup performed prior to starting the benchmark loop does not count
    toward the benchmark measurement. Likewise, when it returns false, it stops
    the timer so cleanup code is not measured.

    Within the body of a "for b.Loop() { ... }" loop, arguments to and results
    from function calls within the loop are kept alive, preventing the compiler
    from fully optimizing away the loop body. Currently, this is implemented by
    disabling inlining of functions called in a b.Loop loop. This applies only
    to calls syntactically between the curly braces of the loop, and the loop
    condition must be written exactly as "b.Loop()". Optimizations are performed
    as usual in any functions called by the loop.

    After Loop returns false, b.N contains the total number of iterations that
    ran, so the benchmark may use b.N to compute other average metrics.

    Prior to the introduction of Loop, benchmarks were expected to contain an
    explicit loop from 0 to b.N. Benchmarks should either use Loop or contain
    a loop to b.N, but not both. Loop offers more automatic management of the
    benchmark timer, and runs each benchmark function only once per measurement,
    whereas b.N-based benchmarks must run the benchmark function (and any
    associated setup and cleanup) several times.

func (c *B) Name() string
    Name returns the name of the running (sub-) test or benchmark.

    The name will include the name of the test along with the names of any
    nested sub-tests. If two sibling sub-tests have the same name, Name will
    append a suffix to guarantee the returned name is unique.

func (c *B) Output() io.Writer
    Output returns a Writer that writes to the same test output stream as
    TB.Log. The output is indented like TB.Log lines, but Output does not add
    source locations or newlines. The output is internally line buffered, and
    a call to TB.Log or the end of the test will implicitly flush the buffer,
    followed by a newline. After a test function and all its parents return,
    neither Output nor the Write method may be called.

func (b *B) ReportAllocs()
    ReportAllocs enables malloc statistics for this benchmark. It is equivalent
    to setting -test.benchmem, but it only affects the benchmark function that
    calls ReportAllocs.

func (b *B) ReportMetric(n float64, unit string)
    ReportMetric adds "n unit" to the reported benchmark results. If the metric
    is per-iteration, the caller should divide by b.N, and by convention units
    should end in "/op". ReportMetric overrides any previously reported value
    for the same unit. ReportMetric panics if unit is the empty string or if
    unit contains any whitespace. If unit is a unit normally reported by the
    benchmark framework itself (such as "allocs/op"), ReportMetric will override
    that metric. Setting "ns/op" to 0 will suppress that built-in metric.

func (b *B) ResetTimer()
    ResetTimer zeroes the elapsed benchmark time and memory allocation counters
    and deletes user-reported metrics. It does not affect whether the timer is
    running.

func (b *B) Run(name string, f func(b *B)) bool
    Run benchmarks f as a subbenchmark with the given name. It reports whether
    there were any failures.

    A subbenchmark is like any other benchmark. A benchmark that calls Run at
    least once will not be measured itself and will be called once with N=1.

func (b *B) RunParallel(body func(*PB))
    RunParallel runs a benchmark in parallel. It creates multiple goroutines and
    distributes b.N iterations among them. The number of goroutines defaults
    to GOMAXPROCS. To increase parallelism for non-CPU-bound benchmarks,
    call B.SetParallelism before RunParallel. RunParallel is usually used with
    the go test -cpu flag.

    The body function will be run in each goroutine. It should set up any
    goroutine-local state and then iterate until pb.Next returns false.
    It should not use the B.StartTimer, B.StopTimer, or B.ResetTimer functions,
    because they have global effect. It should also not call B.Run.

    RunParallel reports ns/op values as wall time for the benchmark as a whole,
    not the sum of wall time or CPU time over each parallel goroutine.

func (b *B) SetBytes(n int64)
    SetBytes records the number of bytes processed in a single operation.
    If this is called, the benchmark will report ns/op and MB/s.

func (b *B) SetParallelism(p int)
    SetParallelism sets the number of goroutines used by B.RunParallel to
    p*GOMAXPROCS. There is usually no need to call SetParallelism for CPU-bound
    benchmarks. If p is less than 1, this call will have no effect.

func (c *B) Setenv(key, value string)
    Setenv calls os.Setenv and uses Cleanup to restore the environment variable
    to its original value after the test.

    Because Setenv affects the whole process, it cannot be used in parallel
    tests or tests with parallel ancestors.

func (c *B) Skip(args ...any)
    Skip is equivalent to Log followed by SkipNow.

func (c *B) SkipNow()
    SkipNow marks the test as having been skipped and stops its execution by
    calling runtime.Goexit. If a test fails (see Error, Errorf, Fail) and is
    then skipped, it is still considered to have failed. Execution will continue
    at the next test or benchmark. See also FailNow. SkipNow must be called from
    the goroutine running the test, not from other goroutines created during the
    test. Calling SkipNow does not stop those other goroutines.

func (c *B) Skipf(format string, args ...any)
    Skipf is equivalent to Logf followed by SkipNow.

func (c *B) Skipped() bool
    Skipped reports whether the test was skipped.

func (b *B) StartTimer()
    StartTimer starts timing a test. This function is called automatically
    before a benchmark starts, but it can also be used to resume timing after a
    call to B.StopTimer.

func (b *B) StopTimer()
    StopTimer stops timing a test. This can be used to pause the timer while
    performing steps that you don't want to measure.

func (c *B) TempDir() string
    TempDir returns a temporary directory for the test to use. The directory
    is automatically removed when the test and all its subtests complete.
    Each subsequent call to TempDir returns a unique directory; if the directory
    creation fails, TempDir terminates the test by calling Fatal.

type BenchmarkResult struct {
	N         int           // The number of iterations.
	T         time.Duration // The total time taken.
	Bytes     int64         // Bytes processed in one iteration.
	MemAllocs uint64        // The total number of memory allocations.
	MemBytes  uint64        // The total number of bytes allocated.

	// Extra records additional metrics reported by ReportMetric.
	Extra map[string]float64
}
    BenchmarkResult contains the results of a benchmark run.

func Benchmark(f func(b *B)) BenchmarkResult
    Benchmark benchmarks a single function. It is useful for creating custom
    benchmarks that do not use the "go test" command.

    If f depends on testing flags, then Init must be used to register those
    flags before calling Benchmark and before calling flag.Parse.

    If f calls Run, the result will be an estimate of running all its
    subbenchmarks that don't call Run in sequence in a single benchmark.

func (r BenchmarkResult) AllocedBytesPerOp() int64
    AllocedBytesPerOp returns the "B/op" metric, which is calculated as
    r.MemBytes / r.N.

func (r BenchmarkResult) AllocsPerOp() int64
    AllocsPerOp returns the "allocs/op" metric, which is calculated as
    r.MemAllocs / r.N.

func (r BenchmarkResult) MemString() string
    MemString returns r.AllocedBytesPerOp and r.AllocsPerOp in the same format
    as 'go test'.

func (r BenchmarkResult) NsPerOp() int64
    NsPerOp returns the "ns/op" metric.

func (r BenchmarkResult) String() string
    String returns a summary of the benchmark results. It follows the benchmark
    result line format from https://golang.org/design/14313-benchmark-format,
    not including the benchmark name. Extra metrics override built-in metrics
    of the same name. String does not include allocs/op or B/op, since those are
    reported by BenchmarkResult.MemString.

type Cover struct {
	Mode            string
	Counters        map[string][]uint32
	Blocks          map[string][]CoverBlock
	CoveredPackages string
}
    Cover records information about test coverage checking. NOTE: This struct
    is internal to the testing infrastructure and may change. It is not covered
    (yet) by the Go 1 compatibility guidelines.

type CoverBlock struct {
	Line0 uint32 // Line number for block start.
	Col0  uint16 // Column number for block start.
	Line1 uint32 // Line number for block end.
	Col1  uint16 // Column number for block end.
	Stmts uint16 // Number of statements included in this block.
}
    CoverBlock records the coverage data for a single basic block. The fields
    are 1-indexed, as in an editor: The opening line of the file is number 1,
    for example. Columns are measured in bytes. NOTE: This struct is internal to
    the testing infrastructure and may change. It is not covered (yet) by the Go
    1 compatibility guidelines.

type F struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    F is a type passed to fuzz tests.

    Fuzz tests run generated inputs against a provided fuzz target, which can
    find and report potential bugs in the code being tested.

    A fuzz test runs the seed corpus by default, which includes entries provided
    by F.Add and entries in the testdata/fuzz/<FuzzTestName> directory.
    After any necessary setup and calls to F.Add, the fuzz test must then call
    F.Fuzz to provide the fuzz target. See the testing package documentation for
    an example, and see the F.Fuzz and F.Add method documentation for details.

    *F methods can only be called before F.Fuzz. Once the test is executing
    the fuzz target, only *T methods can be used. The only *F methods that are
    allowed in the F.Fuzz function are F.Failed and F.Name.

func (f *F) Add(args ...any)
    Add will add the arguments to the seed corpus for the fuzz test. This will
    be a no-op if called after or within the fuzz target, and args must match
    the arguments for the fuzz target.

func (c *F) Attr(key, value string)
    Attr emits a test attribute associated with this test.

    The key must not contain whitespace. The value must not contain newlines or
    carriage returns.

    The meaning of different attribute keys is left up to continuous integration
    systems and test frameworks.

    Test attributes are emitted immediately in the test log, but they are
    intended to be treated as unordered.

func (c *F) Chdir(dir string)
    Chdir calls os.Chdir and uses Cleanup to restore the current working
    directory to its original value after the test. On Unix, it also sets PWD
    environment variable for the duration of the test.

    Because Chdir affects the whole process, it cannot be used in parallel tests
    or tests with parallel ancestors.

func (c *F) Cleanup(f func())
    Cleanup registers a function to be called when the test (or subtest) and
    all its subtests complete. Cleanup functions will be called in last added,
    first called order.

func (c *F) Context() context.Context
    Context returns a context that is canceled just before Cleanup-registered
    functions are called.

    Cleanup functions can wait for any resources that shut down on
    context.Context.Done before the test or benchmark completes.

func (c *F) Error(args ...any)
    Error is equivalent to Log followed by Fail.

func (c *F) Errorf(format string, args ...any)
    Errorf is equivalent to Logf followed by Fail.

func (f *F) Fail()
    Fail marks the function as having failed but continues execution.

func (c *F) FailNow()
    FailNow marks the function as having failed and stops its execution by
    calling runtime.Goexit (which then runs all deferred calls in the current
    goroutine). Execution will continue at the next test or benchmark. FailNow
    must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function,
    not from other goroutines created during the test. Calling FailNow does not
    stop those other goroutines.

func (c *F) Failed() bool
    Failed reports whether the function has failed.

func (c *F) Fatal(args ...any)
    Fatal is equivalent to Log followed by FailNow.

func (c *F) Fatalf(format string, args ...any)
    Fatalf is equivalent to Logf followed by FailNow.

func (f *F) Fuzz(ff any)
    Fuzz runs the fuzz function, ff, for fuzz testing. If ff fails for a set of
    arguments, those arguments will be added to the seed corpus.

    ff must be a function with no return value whose first argument is *T and
    whose remaining arguments are the types to be fuzzed. For example:

        f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, b []byte, i int) { ... })

    The following types are allowed: []byte, string, bool, byte, rune, float32,
    float64, int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32,
    uint64. More types may be supported in the future.

    ff must not call any *F methods, e.g. F.Log, F.Error, F.Skip. Use the
    corresponding *T method instead. The only *F methods that are allowed in the
    F.Fuzz function are F.Failed and F.Name.

    This function should be fast and deterministic, and its behavior should not
    depend on shared state. No mutable input arguments, or pointers to them,
    should be retained between executions of the fuzz function, as the memory
    backing them may be mutated during a subsequent invocation. ff must not
    modify the underlying data of the arguments provided by the fuzzing engine.

    When fuzzing, F.Fuzz does not return until a problem is found, time runs out
    (set with -fuzztime), or the test process is interrupted by a signal. F.Fuzz
    should be called exactly once, unless F.Skip or F.Fail is called beforehand.

func (f *F) Helper()
    Helper marks the calling function as a test helper function. When printing
    file and line information, that function will be skipped. Helper may be
    called simultaneously from multiple goroutines.

func (c *F) Log(args ...any)
    Log formats its arguments using default formatting, analogous to
    fmt.Println, and records the text in the error log. For tests, the text
    will be printed only if the test fails or the -test.v flag is set. For
    benchmarks, the text is always printed to avoid having performance depend
    on the value of the -test.v flag. It is an error to call Log after a test or
    benchmark returns.

func (c *F) Logf(format string, args ...any)
    Logf formats its arguments according to the format, analogous to fmt.Printf,
    and records the text in the error log. A final newline is added if not
    provided. For tests, the text will be printed only if the test fails or the
    -test.v flag is set. For benchmarks, the text is always printed to avoid
    having performance depend on the value of the -test.v flag. It is an error
    to call Logf after a test or benchmark returns.

func (c *F) Name() string
    Name returns the name of the running (sub-) test or benchmark.

    The name will include the name of the test along with the names of any
    nested sub-tests. If two sibling sub-tests have the same name, Name will
    append a suffix to guarantee the returned name is unique.

func (c *F) Output() io.Writer
    Output returns a Writer that writes to the same test output stream as
    TB.Log. The output is indented like TB.Log lines, but Output does not add
    source locations or newlines. The output is internally line buffered, and
    a call to TB.Log or the end of the test will implicitly flush the buffer,
    followed by a newline. After a test function and all its parents return,
    neither Output nor the Write method may be called.

func (c *F) Setenv(key, value string)
    Setenv calls os.Setenv and uses Cleanup to restore the environment variable
    to its original value after the test.

    Because Setenv affects the whole process, it cannot be used in parallel
    tests or tests with parallel ancestors.

func (c *F) Skip(args ...any)
    Skip is equivalent to Log followed by SkipNow.

func (c *F) SkipNow()
    SkipNow marks the test as having been skipped and stops its execution by
    calling runtime.Goexit. If a test fails (see Error, Errorf, Fail) and is
    then skipped, it is still considered to have failed. Execution will continue
    at the next test or benchmark. See also FailNow. SkipNow must be called from
    the goroutine running the test, not from other goroutines created during the
    test. Calling SkipNow does not stop those other goroutines.

func (c *F) Skipf(format string, args ...any)
    Skipf is equivalent to Logf followed by SkipNow.

func (f *F) Skipped() bool
    Skipped reports whether the test was skipped.

func (c *F) TempDir() string
    TempDir returns a temporary directory for the test to use. The directory
    is automatically removed when the test and all its subtests complete.
    Each subsequent call to TempDir returns a unique directory; if the directory
    creation fails, TempDir terminates the test by calling Fatal.

type InternalBenchmark struct {
	Name string
	F    func(b *B)
}
    InternalBenchmark is an internal type but exported because it is
    cross-package; it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

type InternalExample struct {
	Name      string
	F         func()
	Output    string
	Unordered bool
}

type InternalFuzzTarget struct {
	Name string
	Fn   func(f *F)
}
    InternalFuzzTarget is an internal type but exported because it is
    cross-package; it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

type InternalTest struct {
	Name string
	F    func(*T)
}
    InternalTest is an internal type but exported because it is cross-package;
    it is part of the implementation of the "go test" command.

type M struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    M is a type passed to a TestMain function to run the actual tests.

func MainStart(deps testDeps, tests []InternalTest, benchmarks []InternalBenchmark, fuzzTargets []InternalFuzzTarget, examples []InternalExample) *M
    MainStart is meant for use by tests generated by 'go test'. It is not meant
    to be called directly and is not subject to the Go 1 compatibility document.
    It may change signature from release to release.

func (m *M) Run() (code int)
    Run runs the tests. It returns an exit code to pass to os.Exit. The exit
    code is zero when all tests pass, and non-zero for any kind of failure.
    For machine readable test results, parse the output of 'go test -json'.

type PB struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A PB is used by RunParallel for running parallel benchmarks.

func (pb *PB) Next() bool
    Next reports whether there are more iterations to execute.

type T struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    T is a type passed to Test functions to manage test state and support
    formatted test logs.

    A test ends when its Test function returns or calls any of the methods
    T.FailNow, T.Fatal, T.Fatalf, T.SkipNow, T.Skip, or T.Skipf. Those methods,
    as well as the T.Parallel method, must be called only from the goroutine
    running the Test function.

    The other reporting methods, such as the variations of T.Log and T.Error,
    may be called simultaneously from multiple goroutines.

func (c *T) Attr(key, value string)
    Attr emits a test attribute associated with this test.

    The key must not contain whitespace. The value must not contain newlines or
    carriage returns.

    The meaning of different attribute keys is left up to continuous integration
    systems and test frameworks.

    Test attributes are emitted immediately in the test log, but they are
    intended to be treated as unordered.

func (t *T) Chdir(dir string)
    Chdir calls os.Chdir and uses Cleanup to restore the current working
    directory to its original value after the test. On Unix, it also sets PWD
    environment variable for the duration of the test.

    Because Chdir affects the whole process, it cannot be used in parallel tests
    or tests with parallel ancestors.

func (c *T) Cleanup(f func())
    Cleanup registers a function to be called when the test (or subtest) and
    all its subtests complete. Cleanup functions will be called in last added,
    first called order.

func (c *T) Context() context.Context
    Context returns a context that is canceled just before Cleanup-registered
    functions are called.

    Cleanup functions can wait for any resources that shut down on
    context.Context.Done before the test or benchmark completes.

func (t *T) Deadline() (deadline time.Time, ok bool)
    Deadline reports the time at which the test binary will have exceeded the
    timeout specified by the -timeout flag.

    The ok result is false if the -timeout flag indicates “no timeout” (0).

func (c *T) Error(args ...any)
    Error is equivalent to Log followed by Fail.

func (c *T) Errorf(format string, args ...any)
    Errorf is equivalent to Logf followed by Fail.

func (c *T) Fail()
    Fail marks the function as having failed but continues execution.

func (c *T) FailNow()
    FailNow marks the function as having failed and stops its execution by
    calling runtime.Goexit (which then runs all deferred calls in the current
    goroutine). Execution will continue at the next test or benchmark. FailNow
    must be called from the goroutine running the test or benchmark function,
    not from other goroutines created during the test. Calling FailNow does not
    stop those other goroutines.

func (c *T) Failed() bool
    Failed reports whether the function has failed.

func (c *T) Fatal(args ...any)
    Fatal is equivalent to Log followed by FailNow.

func (c *T) Fatalf(format string, args ...any)
    Fatalf is equivalent to Logf followed by FailNow.

func (c *T) Helper()
    Helper marks the calling function as a test helper function. When printing
    file and line information, that function will be skipped. Helper may be
    called simultaneously from multiple goroutines.

func (c *T) Log(args ...any)
    Log formats its arguments using default formatting, analogous to
    fmt.Println, and records the text in the error log. For tests, the text
    will be printed only if the test fails or the -test.v flag is set. For
    benchmarks, the text is always printed to avoid having performance depend
    on the value of the -test.v flag. It is an error to call Log after a test or
    benchmark returns.

func (c *T) Logf(format string, args ...any)
    Logf formats its arguments according to the format, analogous to fmt.Printf,
    and records the text in the error log. A final newline is added if not
    provided. For tests, the text will be printed only if the test fails or the
    -test.v flag is set. For benchmarks, the text is always printed to avoid
    having performance depend on the value of the -test.v flag. It is an error
    to call Logf after a test or benchmark returns.

func (c *T) Name() string
    Name returns the name of the running (sub-) test or benchmark.

    The name will include the name of the test along with the names of any
    nested sub-tests. If two sibling sub-tests have the same name, Name will
    append a suffix to guarantee the returned name is unique.

func (c *T) Output() io.Writer
    Output returns a Writer that writes to the same test output stream as
    TB.Log. The output is indented like TB.Log lines, but Output does not add
    source locations or newlines. The output is internally line buffered, and
    a call to TB.Log or the end of the test will implicitly flush the buffer,
    followed by a newline. After a test function and all its parents return,
    neither Output nor the Write method may be called.

func (t *T) Parallel()
    Parallel signals that this test is to be run in parallel with (and only
    with) other parallel tests. When a test is run multiple times due to use of
    -test.count or -test.cpu, multiple instances of a single test never run in
    parallel with each other.

func (t *T) Run(name string, f func(t *T)) bool
    Run runs f as a subtest of t called name. It runs f in a separate goroutine
    and blocks until f returns or calls t.Parallel to become a parallel test.
    Run reports whether f succeeded (or at least did not fail before calling
    t.Parallel).

    Run may be called simultaneously from multiple goroutines, but all such
    calls must return before the outer test function for t returns.

func (t *T) Setenv(key, value string)
    Setenv calls os.Setenv(key, value) and uses Cleanup to restore the
    environment variable to its original value after the test.

    Because Setenv affects the whole process, it cannot be used in parallel
    tests or tests with parallel ancestors.

func (c *T) Skip(args ...any)
    Skip is equivalent to Log followed by SkipNow.

func (c *T) SkipNow()
    SkipNow marks the test as having been skipped and stops its execution by
    calling runtime.Goexit. If a test fails (see Error, Errorf, Fail) and is
    then skipped, it is still considered to have failed. Execution will continue
    at the next test or benchmark. See also FailNow. SkipNow must be called from
    the goroutine running the test, not from other goroutines created during the
    test. Calling SkipNow does not stop those other goroutines.

func (c *T) Skipf(format string, args ...any)
    Skipf is equivalent to Logf followed by SkipNow.

func (c *T) Skipped() bool
    Skipped reports whether the test was skipped.

func (c *T) TempDir() string
    TempDir returns a temporary directory for the test to use. The directory
    is automatically removed when the test and all its subtests complete.
    Each subsequent call to TempDir returns a unique directory; if the directory
    creation fails, TempDir terminates the test by calling Fatal.
