package atomic // import "internal/runtime/atomic"

Package atomic provides atomic operations, independent of sync/atomic, to the
runtime.

On most platforms, the compiler is aware of the functions defined in this
package, and they're replaced with platform-specific intrinsics. On other
platforms, generic implementations are made available.

Unless otherwise noted, operations defined in this package are sequentially
consistent across threads with respect to the values they manipulate.
More specifically, operations that happen in a specific order on one thread,
will always be observed to happen in exactly that order by another thread.
