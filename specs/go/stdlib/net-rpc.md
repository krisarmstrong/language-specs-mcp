package rpc // import "net/rpc"

Package rpc provides access to the exported methods of an object across a
network or other I/O connection.

The net/rpc package is frozen and is not accepting new features.

A server registers an object, making it visible as a service with the name of
the type of the object. After registration, exported methods of the object will
be accessible remotely. A server may register multiple objects (services) of
different types but it is an error to register multiple objects of the same
type.

Only methods that satisfy these criteria will be made available for remote
access; other methods will be ignored:

  - the method's type is exported.
  - the method is exported.
  - the method has two arguments, both exported (or builtin) types.
  - the method's second argument is a pointer.
  - the method has return type error.

In effect, the method must look schematically like

    func (t *T) MethodName(argType T1, replyType *T2) error

where T1 and T2 can be marshaled by encoding/gob. These requirements apply even
if a different codec is used. (In the future, these requirements may soften for
custom codecs.)

The method's first argument represents the arguments provided by the caller;
the second argument represents the result parameters to be returned to the
caller. The method's return value, if non-nil, is passed back as a string that
the client sees as if created by errors.New. If an error is returned, the reply
parameter will not be sent back to the client.

The server may handle requests on a single connection by calling ServeConn.
More typically it will create a network listener and call Accept or, for an HTTP
listener, HandleHTTP and http.Serve.

A client wishing to use the service establishes a connection and then invokes
NewClient on the connection. The convenience function Dial (DialHTTP) performs
both steps for a raw network connection (an HTTP connection). The resulting
Client object has two methods, Call and Go, that specify the service and method
to call, a pointer containing the arguments, and a pointer to receive the result
parameters.

The Call method waits for the remote call to complete while the Go method
launches the call asynchronously and signals completion using the Call
structure's Done channel.

Unless an explicit codec is set up, package encoding/gob is used to transport
the data.

Here is a simple example. A server wishes to export an object of type Arith:

    package server

    import "errors"

    type Args struct {
    	A, B int
    }

    type Quotient struct {
    	Quo, Rem int
    }

    type Arith int

    func (t *Arith) Multiply(args *Args, reply *int) error {
    	*reply = args.A * args.B
    	return nil
    }

    func (t *Arith) Divide(args *Args, quo *Quotient) error {
    	if args.B == 0 {
    		return errors.New("divide by zero")
    	}
    	quo.Quo = args.A / args.B
    	quo.Rem = args.A % args.B
    	return nil
    }

The server calls (for HTTP service):

    arith := new(Arith)
    rpc.Register(arith)
    rpc.HandleHTTP()
    l, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":1234")
    if err != nil {
    	log.Fatal("listen error:", err)
    }
    go http.Serve(l, nil)

At this point, clients can see a service "Arith" with methods "Arith.Multiply"
and "Arith.Divide". To invoke one, a client first dials the server:

    client, err := rpc.DialHTTP("tcp", serverAddress + ":1234")
    if err != nil {
    	log.Fatal("dialing:", err)
    }

Then it can make a remote call:

    // Synchronous call
    args := &server.Args{7,8}
    var reply int
    err = client.Call("Arith.Multiply", args, &reply)
    if err != nil {
    	log.Fatal("arith error:", err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Arith: %d*%d=%d", args.A, args.B, reply)

or

    // Asynchronous call
    quotient := new(Quotient)
    divCall := client.Go("Arith.Divide", args, quotient, nil)
    replyCall := <-divCall.Done	// will be equal to divCall
    // check errors, print, etc.

A server implementation will often provide a simple, type-safe wrapper for the
client.

CONSTANTS

const (
	// Defaults used by HandleHTTP
	DefaultRPCPath   = "/_goRPC_"
	DefaultDebugPath = "/debug/rpc"
)

VARIABLES

var DefaultServer = NewServer()
    DefaultServer is the default instance of *Server.

var ErrShutdown = errors.New("connection is shut down")

FUNCTIONS

func Accept(lis net.Listener)
    Accept accepts connections on the listener and serves requests to
    DefaultServer for each incoming connection. Accept blocks; the caller
    typically invokes it in a go statement.

func HandleHTTP()
    HandleHTTP registers an HTTP handler for RPC messages to DefaultServer on
    DefaultRPCPath and a debugging handler on DefaultDebugPath. It is still
    necessary to invoke http.Serve(), typically in a go statement.

func Register(rcvr any) error
    Register publishes the receiver's methods in the DefaultServer.

func RegisterName(name string, rcvr any) error
    RegisterName is like Register but uses the provided name for the type
    instead of the receiver's concrete type.

func ServeCodec(codec ServerCodec)
    ServeCodec is like ServeConn but uses the specified codec to decode requests
    and encode responses.

func ServeConn(conn io.ReadWriteCloser)
    ServeConn runs the DefaultServer on a single connection. ServeConn blocks,
    serving the connection until the client hangs up. The caller typically
    invokes ServeConn in a go statement. ServeConn uses the gob wire format (see
    package gob) on the connection. To use an alternate codec, use ServeCodec.
    See NewClient's comment for information about concurrent access.

func ServeRequest(codec ServerCodec) error
    ServeRequest is like ServeCodec but synchronously serves a single request.
    It does not close the codec upon completion.


TYPES

type Call struct {
	ServiceMethod string     // The name of the service and method to call.
	Args          any        // The argument to the function (*struct).
	Reply         any        // The reply from the function (*struct).
	Error         error      // After completion, the error status.
	Done          chan *Call // Receives *Call when Go is complete.
}
    Call represents an active RPC.

type Client struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Client represents an RPC Client. There may be multiple outstanding Calls
    associated with a single Client, and a Client may be used by multiple
    goroutines simultaneously.

func Dial(network, address string) (*Client, error)
    Dial connects to an RPC server at the specified network address.

func DialHTTP(network, address string) (*Client, error)
    DialHTTP connects to an HTTP RPC server at the specified network address
    listening on the default HTTP RPC path.

func DialHTTPPath(network, address, path string) (*Client, error)
    DialHTTPPath connects to an HTTP RPC server at the specified network address
    and path.

func NewClient(conn io.ReadWriteCloser) *Client
    NewClient returns a new Client to handle requests to the set of services at
    the other end of the connection. It adds a buffer to the write side of the
    connection so the header and payload are sent as a unit.

    The read and write halves of the connection are serialized independently, so
    no interlocking is required. However each half may be accessed concurrently
    so the implementation of conn should protect against concurrent reads or
    concurrent writes.

func NewClientWithCodec(codec ClientCodec) *Client
    NewClientWithCodec is like NewClient but uses the specified codec to encode
    requests and decode responses.

func (client *Client) Call(serviceMethod string, args any, reply any) error
    Call invokes the named function, waits for it to complete, and returns its
    error status.

func (client *Client) Close() error
    Close calls the underlying codec's Close method. If the connection is
    already shutting down, ErrShutdown is returned.

func (client *Client) Go(serviceMethod string, args any, reply any, done chan *Call) *Call
    Go invokes the function asynchronously. It returns the Call structure
    representing the invocation. The done channel will signal when the call is
    complete by returning the same Call object. If done is nil, Go will allocate
    a new channel. If non-nil, done must be buffered or Go will deliberately
    crash.

type ClientCodec interface {
	WriteRequest(*Request, any) error
	ReadResponseHeader(*Response) error
	ReadResponseBody(any) error

	Close() error
}
    A ClientCodec implements writing of RPC requests and reading of RPC
    responses for the client side of an RPC session. The client calls
    [ClientCodec.WriteRequest] to write a request to the connection and calls
    [ClientCodec.ReadResponseHeader] and [ClientCodec.ReadResponseBody] in pairs
    to read responses. The client calls [ClientCodec.Close] when finished with
    the connection. ReadResponseBody may be called with a nil argument to force
    the body of the response to be read and then discarded. See NewClient's
    comment for information about concurrent access.

type Request struct {
	ServiceMethod string // format: "Service.Method"
	Seq           uint64 // sequence number chosen by client
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Request is a header written before every RPC call. It is used internally
    but documented here as an aid to debugging, such as when analyzing network
    traffic.

type Response struct {
	ServiceMethod string // echoes that of the Request
	Seq           uint64 // echoes that of the request
	Error         string // error, if any.
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Response is a header written before every RPC return. It is used internally
    but documented here as an aid to debugging, such as when analyzing network
    traffic.

type Server struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Server represents an RPC Server.

func NewServer() *Server
    NewServer returns a new Server.

func (server *Server) Accept(lis net.Listener)
    Accept accepts connections on the listener and serves requests for each
    incoming connection. Accept blocks until the listener returns a non-nil
    error. The caller typically invokes Accept in a go statement.

func (server *Server) HandleHTTP(rpcPath, debugPath string)
    HandleHTTP registers an HTTP handler for RPC messages on rpcPath,
    and a debugging handler on debugPath. It is still necessary to invoke
    http.Serve(), typically in a go statement.

func (server *Server) Register(rcvr any) error
    Register publishes in the server the set of methods of the receiver value
    that satisfy the following conditions:
      - exported method of exported type
      - two arguments, both of exported type
      - the second argument is a pointer
      - one return value, of type error

    It returns an error if the receiver is not an exported type or has no
    suitable methods. It also logs the error using package log. The client
    accesses each method using a string of the form "Type.Method", where Type is
    the receiver's concrete type.

func (server *Server) RegisterName(name string, rcvr any) error
    RegisterName is like Register but uses the provided name for the type
    instead of the receiver's concrete type.

func (server *Server) ServeCodec(codec ServerCodec)
    ServeCodec is like ServeConn but uses the specified codec to decode requests
    and encode responses.

func (server *Server) ServeConn(conn io.ReadWriteCloser)
    ServeConn runs the server on a single connection. ServeConn blocks,
    serving the connection until the client hangs up. The caller typically
    invokes ServeConn in a go statement. ServeConn uses the gob wire format (see
    package gob) on the connection. To use an alternate codec, use ServeCodec.
    See NewClient's comment for information about concurrent access.

func (server *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request)
    ServeHTTP implements an http.Handler that answers RPC requests.

func (server *Server) ServeRequest(codec ServerCodec) error
    ServeRequest is like ServeCodec but synchronously serves a single request.
    It does not close the codec upon completion.

type ServerCodec interface {
	ReadRequestHeader(*Request) error
	ReadRequestBody(any) error
	WriteResponse(*Response, any) error

	// Close can be called multiple times and must be idempotent.
	Close() error
}
    A ServerCodec implements reading of RPC requests and writing of RPC
    responses for the server side of an RPC session. The server calls
    [ServerCodec.ReadRequestHeader] and [ServerCodec.ReadRequestBody]
    in pairs to read requests from the connection, and it calls
    [ServerCodec.WriteResponse] to write a response back. The server calls
    [ServerCodec.Close] when finished with the connection. ReadRequestBody may
    be called with a nil argument to force the body of the request to be read
    and discarded. See NewClient's comment for information about concurrent
    access.

type ServerError string
    ServerError represents an error that has been returned from the remote side
    of the RPC connection.

func (e ServerError) Error() string
