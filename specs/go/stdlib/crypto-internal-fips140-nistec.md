package nistec // import "crypto/internal/fips140/nistec"

Package nistec implements the elliptic curves from NIST SP 800-186.

This package uses fiat-crypto or specialized assembly and Go code for its
backend field arithmetic (not math/big) and exposes constant-time, heap
allocation-free, byte slice-based safe APIs. Group operations use modern and
safe complete addition formulas where possible. The point at infinity is handled
and encoded according to SEC 1, Version 2.0, and invalid curve points can't be
represented.
