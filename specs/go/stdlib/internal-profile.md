package profile // import "internal/profile"

Package profile represents a pprof profile as a directed graph.

This package is a simplified fork of github.com/google/pprof/internal/graph.

Package profile provides a representation of
github.com/google/pprof/proto/profile.proto and methods to encode/decode/merge
profiles in this format.

FUNCTIONS

func CreateNodes(prof *Profile, o *Options) (Nodes, locationMap)
    CreateNodes creates graph nodes for all locations in a profile.
    It returns set of all nodes, plus a mapping of each location to the set of
    corresponding nodes (one per location.Line).


TYPES

type Demangler func(name []string) (map[string]string, error)
    Demangler maps symbol names to a human-readable form. This may include C++
    demangling and additional simplification. Names that are not demangled may
    be missing from the resulting map.

type Edge struct {
	Src, Dest *Node
	// The summary weight of the edge
	Weight, WeightDiv int64

	// residual edges connect nodes that were connected through a
	// separate node, which has been removed from the report.
	Residual bool
	// An inline edge represents a call that was inlined into the caller.
	Inline bool
}
    Edge contains any attributes to be represented about edges in a graph.

func (e *Edge) WeightValue() int64
    WeightValue returns the weight value for this edge, normalizing if a divisor
    is available.

func (em EdgeMap) FindTo(n *Node) *Edge

func (em EdgeMap) Sort() []*Edge
    Sort returns a slice of the edges in the map, in a consistent order.
    The sort order is first based on the edge weight (higher-to-lower) and then
    by the node names to avoid flakiness.

func (em EdgeMap) Sum() int64
    Sum returns the total weight for a set of nodes.

type Node struct {
	// Info describes the source location associated to this node.
	Info NodeInfo

	// Function represents the function that this node belongs to. On
	// graphs with sub-function resolution (eg line number or
	// addresses), two nodes in a NodeMap that are part of the same
	// function have the same value of Node.Function. If the Node
	// represents the whole function, it points back to itself.

    location.

func (n *Node) AddToEdge(to *Node, v int64, residual, inline bool)

    such an edge one is created.

func (n *Node) AddToEdgeDiv(to *Node, dv, v int64, residual, inline bool)
    AddToEdgeDiv increases the weight of an edge between two nodes. If there
    isn't such an edge one is created.

    NodeMap maps from a node info struct to a node. It is used to merge report
    entries with the same info.

func (nm NodeMap) FindOrInsertNode(info NodeInfo, kept NodeSet) *Node
    FindOrInsertNode takes the info for a node and either returns a matching
    node from the node map if one exists, or adds one to the map if one does
    not. If kept is non-nil, nodes are only added if they can be located on it.

type NodePtrSet map[*Node]bool
    NodePtrSet is a collection of nodes. Trimming a graph or tree requires
    a set of objects which uniquely identify the nodes to keep. In a graph,
    NodeInfo works as a unique identifier; however, in a tree multiple nodes may
    share identical NodeInfos. A *Node does uniquely identify a node so we can
    use that instead. Though a *Node also uniquely identifies a node in a graph,
    currently, during trimming, graphs are rebuilt from scratch using only the
    NodeSet, so there would not be the required context of the initial graph to
    allow for the use of *Node.

type NodeSet map[NodeInfo]bool
    NodeSet is a collection of node info structs.

type Nodes []*Node
    Nodes is an ordered collection of graph nodes.

func (ns Nodes) Sum() (flat int64, cum int64)

}
    Options encodes the options for constructing a graph

type Profile struct {

	DefaultSampleType string
	Sample            []*Sample
	Mapping           []*Mapping

	Period        int64

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Profile is an in-memory representation of profile.proto.

func Merge(srcs []*Profile) (*Profile, error)
    Merge merges all the profiles in profs into a single Profile. Returns a new
    profile independent of the input profiles. The merged profile is compacted
    to eliminate unused samples, locations, functions and mappings. Profiles
    must have identical profile sample and period types or the merge will fail.
    profile.Period of the resulting profile will be the maximum of all profiles,
    and profile.TimeNanos will be the earliest nonzero one.

func Parse(r io.Reader) (*Profile, error)
    Parse parses a profile and checks for its validity. The input must be an
    encoded pprof protobuf, which may optionally be gzip-compressed.

func (p *Profile) Aggregate(inlineFrame, function, filename, linenumber, address bool) error
    Aggregate merges the locations in the profile into equivalence classes
    preserving the request attributes. It also updates the samples to point to
    the merged locations.

func (p *Profile) CheckValid() error
    CheckValid tests whether the profile is valid. Checks include, but are not
    limited to:
      - len(Profile.Sample[n].value) == len(Profile.value_unit)
      - Sample.id has a corresponding Profile.Location

func (p *Profile) Compatible(pb *Profile) error
    Compatible determines if two profiles can be compared/merged. returns nil
    if the profiles are compatible; otherwise an error with details on the
    incompatibility.

func (p *Profile) Copy() *Profile
    Copy makes a fully independent copy of a profile.

func (p *Profile) Demangle(d Demangler) error
    Demangle attempts to demangle and optionally simplify any function names
    referenced in the profile. It works on a best-effort basis: it will silently
    preserve the original names in case of any errors.

func (p *Profile) Empty() bool
    Empty reports whether the profile contains no samples.

func (p *Profile) FilterSamplesByTag(focus, ignore TagMatch) (fm, im bool)
    FilterSamplesByTag removes all samples from the profile, except those that
    match focus and do not match the ignore regular expression.

func (p *Profile) HasFileLines() bool
    HasFileLines determines if all locations in this profile have symbolized
    file and line number information.

func (p *Profile) HasFunctions() bool
    HasFunctions determines if all locations in this profile have symbolized
    function information.

func (p *Profile) Merge(pb *Profile, r float64) error
    Merge adds profile p adjusted by ratio r into profile p. Profiles must be
    compatible (same Type and SampleType). TODO(rsilvera): consider normalizing
    the profiles based on the total samples collected.

func (p *Profile) Normalize(pb *Profile) error
    Normalize normalizes the source profile by multiplying each value in profile
    by the ratio of the sum of the base profile's values of that sample type to
    the sum of the source profile's value of that sample type.

func (p *Profile) Prune(dropRx, keepRx *regexp.Regexp)
    Prune removes all nodes beneath a node matching dropRx, and not matching
    keepRx. If the root node of a Sample matches, the sample will have an empty
    stack.

func (p *Profile) RemoveUninteresting() error
    RemoveUninteresting prunes and elides profiles using built-in tables of
    uninteresting function names.

func (p *Profile) Scale(ratio float64)
    Scale multiplies all sample values in a profile by a constant.

func (p *Profile) ScaleN(ratios []float64) error
    ScaleN multiplies each sample values in a sample by a different amount.

func (p *Profile) String() string
    Print dumps a text representation of a profile. Intended mainly for
    debugging purposes.

func (p *Profile) Write(w io.Writer) error
    Write writes the profile as a gzip-compressed marshaled protobuf.
