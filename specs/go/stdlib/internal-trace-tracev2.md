package tracev2 // import "internal/trace/tracev2"

Package tracev2 contains definitions for the v2 execution trace wire format.

These definitions are shared between the trace parser and the runtime, so it
must not depend on any package that depends on the runtime (most packages).

FUNCTIONS

func EventNames(specs []EventSpec) map[string]EventType
    EventNames is a helper that produces a mapping of event names to event
    types.

func Experiments() []string

TYPES

type EventSpec struct {
	// Name is the human-readable name of the trace event.
	Name string

	// Args contains the names of each trace event's argument.
	// Its length determines the number of arguments an event has.
	//
	// Argument names follow a certain structure and this structure
	// is relied on by the testing framework to type-check arguments
	// and to produce Values for experimental events.
	//
	// The structure is:
	//
	//     (?P<name>[A-Za-z]+)(_(?P<type>[A-Za-z]+))?
	//
	// In sum, it's a name followed by an optional type.
	// If the type is present, it is preceded with an underscore.
	// Arguments without types will be interpreted as just raw uint64s.
	// The valid argument types and the Go types they map to are listed
	// in the ArgTypes variable.
	Args []string

	// StringIDs indicates which of the arguments are string IDs.
	StringIDs []int

	// StackIDs indicates which of the arguments are stack IDs.
	//
	// The list is not sorted. The first index always refers to
	// the main stack for the current execution context of the event.
	StackIDs []int

	// StartEv indicates the event type of the corresponding "start"
	// event, if this event is an "end," for a pair of events that
	// represent a time range.
	StartEv EventType

	// IsTimedEvent indicates whether this is an event that both
	// appears in the main event stream and is surfaced to the
	// trace reader.
	//
	// Events that are not "timed" are considered "structural"
	// since they either need significant reinterpretation or
	// otherwise aren't actually surfaced by the trace reader.
	IsTimedEvent bool

	// HasData is true if the event has trailer consisting of a
	// varint length followed by unencoded bytes of some data.
	//
	// An event may not be both a timed event and have data.
	HasData bool

	// IsStack indicates that the event represents a complete
	// stack trace. Specifically, it means that after the arguments
	// there's a varint length, followed by 4*length varints. Each
	// group of 4 represents the PC, file ID, func ID, and line number
	// in that order.
	IsStack bool

	// Experiment indicates the ID of an experiment this event is associated
	// with. If Experiment is not NoExperiment, then the event is experimental
	// and will be exposed as an EventExperiment.
	Experiment Experiment
}
    EventSpec is a specification for a trace event. It contains sufficient
    information to perform basic parsing of any trace event for any version of
    Go.

func Specs() []EventSpec

type EventType uint8
    EventType indicates an event's type from which its arguments and semantics
    can be derived. Its representation matches the wire format's representation
    of the event types that precede all event data.

    Event types in the trace, args are given in square brackets.

    Naming scheme:
      - Time range event pairs have suffixes "Begin" and "End".
      - "Start", "Stop", "Create", "Destroy", "Block", "Unblock" are suffixes
        reserved for scheduling resources.

    NOTE: If you add an event type, make sure you also update all tables in this
    file!
