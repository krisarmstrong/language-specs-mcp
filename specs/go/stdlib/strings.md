package strings // import "strings"

Package strings implements simple functions to manipulate UTF-8 encoded strings.

For information about UTF-8 strings in Go, see https://blog.golang.org/strings.

FUNCTIONS

func Clone(s string) string
    Clone returns a fresh copy of s. It guarantees to make a copy of s into a
    new allocation, which can be important when retaining only a small substring
    of a much larger string. Using Clone can help such programs use less memory.
    Of course, since using Clone makes a copy, overuse of Clone can make
    programs use more memory. Clone should typically be used only rarely,
    and only when profiling indicates that it is needed. For strings of length
    zero the string "" will be returned and no allocation is made.

func Compare(a, b string) int
    Compare returns an integer comparing two strings lexicographically.
    The result will be 0 if a == b, -1 if a < b, and +1 if a > b.

    Use Compare when you need to perform a three-way comparison (with
    slices.SortFunc, for example). It is usually clearer and always faster to
    use the built-in string comparison operators ==, <, >, and so on.

func Contains(s, substr string) bool
    Contains reports whether substr is within s.

func ContainsAny(s, chars string) bool
    ContainsAny reports whether any Unicode code points in chars are within s.

func ContainsFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) bool
    ContainsFunc reports whether any Unicode code points r within s satisfy
    f(r).

func ContainsRune(s string, r rune) bool
    ContainsRune reports whether the Unicode code point r is within s.

func Count(s, substr string) int
    Count counts the number of non-overlapping instances of substr in s.
    If substr is an empty string, Count returns 1 + the number of Unicode code
    points in s.

func Cut(s, sep string) (before, after string, found bool)
    Cut slices s around the first instance of sep, returning the text before and
    after sep. The found result reports whether sep appears in s. If sep does
    not appear in s, cut returns s, "", false.

func CutPrefix(s, prefix string) (after string, found bool)
    CutPrefix returns s without the provided leading prefix string and reports
    whether it found the prefix. If s doesn't start with prefix, CutPrefix
    returns s, false. If prefix is the empty string, CutPrefix returns s, true.

func CutSuffix(s, suffix string) (before string, found bool)
    CutSuffix returns s without the provided ending suffix string and reports
    whether it found the suffix. If s doesn't end with suffix, CutSuffix returns
    s, false. If suffix is the empty string, CutSuffix returns s, true.

func EqualFold(s, t string) bool
    EqualFold reports whether s and t, interpreted as UTF-8 strings,
    are equal under simple Unicode case-folding, which is a more general form of
    case-insensitivity.

func Fields(s string) []string
    Fields splits the string s around each instance of one or more consecutive
    white space characters, as defined by unicode.IsSpace, returning a slice
    of substrings of s or an empty slice if s contains only white space.
    Every element of the returned slice is non-empty. Unlike Split, leading and
    trailing runs runs of white space characters are discarded.

func FieldsFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) []string
    FieldsFunc splits the string s at each run of Unicode code points c
    satisfying f(c) and returns an array of slices of s. If all code points
    in s satisfy f(c) or the string is empty, an empty slice is returned.
    Every element of the returned slice is non-empty. Unlike [SplitFunc],
    leading and trailing runs of code points satisfying f(c) are discarded.

    FieldsFunc makes no guarantees about the order in which it calls f(c) and
    assumes that f always returns the same value for a given c.

func FieldsFuncSeq(s string, f func(rune) bool) iter.Seq[string]
    FieldsFuncSeq returns an iterator over substrings of s split around runs of
    Unicode code points satisfying f(c). The iterator yields the same strings
    that would be returned by FieldsFunc(s), but without constructing the slice.

func FieldsSeq(s string) iter.Seq[string]
    FieldsSeq returns an iterator over substrings of s split around runs
    of whitespace characters, as defined by unicode.IsSpace. The iterator
    yields the same strings that would be returned by Fields(s), but without
    constructing the slice.

func HasPrefix(s, prefix string) bool
    HasPrefix reports whether the string s begins with prefix.

func HasSuffix(s, suffix string) bool
    HasSuffix reports whether the string s ends with suffix.

func Index(s, substr string) int
    Index returns the index of the first instance of substr in s, or -1 if
    substr is not present in s.

func IndexAny(s, chars string) int
    IndexAny returns the index of the first instance of any Unicode code point
    from chars in s, or -1 if no Unicode code point from chars is present in s.

func IndexByte(s string, c byte) int
    IndexByte returns the index of the first instance of c in s, or -1 if c is
    not present in s.

func IndexFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) int
    IndexFunc returns the index into s of the first Unicode code point
    satisfying f(c), or -1 if none do.

func IndexRune(s string, r rune) int
    IndexRune returns the index of the first instance of the Unicode code point
    r, or -1 if rune is not present in s. If r is utf8.RuneError, it returns the
    first instance of any invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.

func Join(elems []string, sep string) string
    Join concatenates the elements of its first argument to create a single
    string. The separator string sep is placed between elements in the resulting
    string.

func LastIndex(s, substr string) int
    LastIndex returns the index of the last instance of substr in s, or -1 if
    substr is not present in s.

func LastIndexAny(s, chars string) int
    LastIndexAny returns the index of the last instance of any Unicode code
    point from chars in s, or -1 if no Unicode code point from chars is present
    in s.

func LastIndexByte(s string, c byte) int
    LastIndexByte returns the index of the last instance of c in s, or -1 if c
    is not present in s.

func LastIndexFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) int
    LastIndexFunc returns the index into s of the last Unicode code point
    satisfying f(c), or -1 if none do.

func Lines(s string) iter.Seq[string]
    Lines returns an iterator over the newline-terminated lines in the string s.
    The lines yielded by the iterator include their terminating newlines.
    If s is empty, the iterator yields no lines at all. If s does not end in
    a newline, the final yielded line will not end in a newline. It returns a
    single-use iterator.

func Map(mapping func(rune) rune, s string) string
    Map returns a copy of the string s with all its characters modified
    according to the mapping function. If mapping returns a negative value,
    the character is dropped from the string with no replacement.

func Repeat(s string, count int) string
    Repeat returns a new string consisting of count copies of the string s.

    It panics if count is negative or if the result of (len(s) * count)
    overflows.

func Replace(s, old, new string, n int) string
    Replace returns a copy of the string s with the first n non-overlapping
    instances of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the
    beginning of the string and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1
    replacements for a k-rune string. If n < 0, there is no limit on the number
    of replacements.

func ReplaceAll(s, old, new string) string
    ReplaceAll returns a copy of the string s with all non-overlapping instances
    of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the beginning of the
    string and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1 replacements for a
    k-rune string.

func Split(s, sep string) []string
    Split slices s into all substrings separated by sep and returns a slice of
    the substrings between those separators.

    If s does not contain sep and sep is not empty, Split returns a slice of
    length 1 whose only element is s.

    If sep is empty, Split splits after each UTF-8 sequence. If both s and sep
    are empty, Split returns an empty slice.

    It is equivalent to SplitN with a count of -1.

    To split around the first instance of a separator, see Cut.

func SplitAfter(s, sep string) []string
    SplitAfter slices s into all substrings after each instance of sep and
    returns a slice of those substrings.

    If s does not contain sep and sep is not empty, SplitAfter returns a slice
    of length 1 whose only element is s.

    If sep is empty, SplitAfter splits after each UTF-8 sequence. If both s and
    sep are empty, SplitAfter returns an empty slice.

    It is equivalent to SplitAfterN with a count of -1.

func SplitAfterN(s, sep string, n int) []string
    SplitAfterN slices s into substrings after each instance of sep and returns
    a slice of those substrings.

    The count determines the number of substrings to return:
      - n > 0: at most n substrings; the last substring will be the unsplit
        remainder;
      - n == 0: the result is nil (zero substrings);
      - n < 0: all substrings.

    Edge cases for s and sep (for example, empty strings) are handled as
    described in the documentation for SplitAfter.

func SplitAfterSeq(s, sep string) iter.Seq[string]
    SplitAfterSeq returns an iterator over substrings of s split after each
    instance of sep. The iterator yields the same strings that would be returned
    by SplitAfter(s, sep), but without constructing the slice. It returns a
    single-use iterator.

func SplitN(s, sep string, n int) []string
    SplitN slices s into substrings separated by sep and returns a slice of the
    substrings between those separators.

    The count determines the number of substrings to return:
      - n > 0: at most n substrings; the last substring will be the unsplit
        remainder;
      - n == 0: the result is nil (zero substrings);
      - n < 0: all substrings.

    Edge cases for s and sep (for example, empty strings) are handled as
    described in the documentation for Split.

    To split around the first instance of a separator, see Cut.

func SplitSeq(s, sep string) iter.Seq[string]
    SplitSeq returns an iterator over all substrings of s separated by sep.
    The iterator yields the same strings that would be returned by Split(s,
    sep), but without constructing the slice. It returns a single-use iterator.

func Title(s string) string
    Title returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters that begin
    words mapped to their Unicode title case.

    Deprecated: The rule Title uses for word boundaries does not handle Unicode
    punctuation properly. Use golang.org/x/text/cases instead.

func ToLower(s string) string
    ToLower returns s with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case.

func ToLowerSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s string) string
    ToLowerSpecial returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters
    mapped to their lower case using the case mapping specified by c.

func ToTitle(s string) string

    their Unicode title case.

func ToTitleSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s string) string
    ToTitleSpecial returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters
    mapped to their Unicode title case, giving priority to the special casing
    rules.

func ToUpper(s string) string
    ToUpper returns s with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case.

func ToUpperSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s string) string
    ToUpperSpecial returns a copy of the string s with all Unicode letters
    mapped to their upper case using the case mapping specified by c.

func ToValidUTF8(s, replacement string) string
    ToValidUTF8 returns a copy of the string s with each run of invalid UTF-8
    byte sequences replaced by the replacement string, which may be empty.

func Trim(s, cutset string) string
    Trim returns a slice of the string s with all leading and trailing Unicode
    code points contained in cutset removed.

func TrimFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) string
    TrimFunc returns a slice of the string s with all leading and trailing
    Unicode code points c satisfying f(c) removed.

func TrimLeft(s, cutset string) string
    TrimLeft returns a slice of the string s with all leading Unicode code
    points contained in cutset removed.

    To remove a prefix, use TrimPrefix instead.

func TrimLeftFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) string
    TrimLeftFunc returns a slice of the string s with all leading Unicode code
    points c satisfying f(c) removed.

func TrimPrefix(s, prefix string) string
    TrimPrefix returns s without the provided leading prefix string. If s
    doesn't start with prefix, s is returned unchanged.

func TrimRight(s, cutset string) string
    TrimRight returns a slice of the string s, with all trailing Unicode code
    points contained in cutset removed.

    To remove a suffix, use TrimSuffix instead.

func TrimRightFunc(s string, f func(rune) bool) string
    TrimRightFunc returns a slice of the string s with all trailing Unicode code
    points c satisfying f(c) removed.

func TrimSpace(s string) string
    TrimSpace returns a slice of the string s, with all leading and trailing
    white space removed, as defined by Unicode.

func TrimSuffix(s, suffix string) string
    TrimSuffix returns s without the provided trailing suffix string. If s
    doesn't end with suffix, s is returned unchanged.


TYPES

type Builder struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}

    bytes. After Grow(n), at least n bytes can be written to b without another
    allocation. If n is negative, Grow panics.

func (b *Builder) Len() int
    Len returns the number of accumulated bytes; b.Len() == len(b.String()).

func (b *Builder) Reset()

    A Reader implements the io.Reader, io.ReaderAt, io.ByteReader,
    io.ByteScanner, io.RuneReader, io.RuneScanner, io.Seeker, and io.WriterTo
    interfaces by reading from a string. The zero value for Reader operates like
    a Reader of an empty string.

    WriteTo implements the io.WriterTo interface.

type Replacer struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Replacer replaces a list of strings with replacements. It is safe for
    concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

func NewReplacer(oldnew ...string) *Replacer
    NewReplacer returns a new Replacer from a list of old, new string pairs.
    Replacements are performed in the order they appear in the target string,
    without overlapping matches. The old string comparisons are done in argument
    order.
