package errors // import "errors"

Package errors implements functions to manipulate errors.

The New function creates errors whose only content is a text message.

An error e wraps another error if e's type has one of the methods

    Unwrap() error
    Unwrap() []error

If e.Unwrap() returns a non-nil error w or a slice containing w, then we say
that e wraps w. A nil error returned from e.Unwrap() indicates that e does
not wrap any error. It is invalid for an Unwrap method to return an []error
containing a nil error value.

An easy way to create wrapped errors is to call fmt.Errorf and apply the %w verb
to the error argument:

    wrapsErr := fmt.Errorf("... %w ...", ..., err, ...)

Successive unwrapping of an error creates a tree. The Is and As functions
inspect an error's tree by examining first the error itself followed by the tree
of each of its children in turn (pre-order, depth-first traversal).

See https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors for a deeper discussion of the philosophy
of wrapping and when to wrap.

Is examines the tree of its first argument looking for an error that matches the
second. It reports whether it finds a match. It should be used in preference to
simple equality checks:

    if errors.Is(err, fs.ErrExist)

is preferable to

    if err == fs.ErrExist

because the former will succeed if err wraps io/fs.ErrExist.

As examines the tree of its first argument looking for an error that can be
assigned to its second argument, which must be a pointer. If it succeeds, it
performs the assignment and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. The form

    var perr *fs.PathError
    if errors.As(err, &perr) {
    	fmt.Println(perr.Path)
    }

is preferable to

    if perr, ok := err.(*fs.PathError); ok {
    	fmt.Println(perr.Path)
    }

because the former will succeed if err wraps an *io/fs.PathError.

VARIABLES

var ErrUnsupported = New("unsupported operation")
    ErrUnsupported indicates that a requested operation cannot be performed,
    because it is unsupported. For example, a call to os.Link when using a file
    system that does not support hard links.

    Functions and methods should not return this error but should instead return
    an error including appropriate context that satisfies

        errors.Is(err, errors.ErrUnsupported)

    either by directly wrapping ErrUnsupported or by implementing an Is method.

    Functions and methods should document the cases in which an error wrapping
    this will be returned.


FUNCTIONS

func As(err error, target any) bool
    As finds the first error in err's tree that matches target, and if one
    is found, sets target to that error value and returns true. Otherwise,
    it returns false.

    The tree consists of err itself, followed by the errors obtained by
    repeatedly calling its Unwrap() error or Unwrap() []error method. When err
    wraps multiple errors, As examines err followed by a depth-first traversal
    of its children.

    An error matches target if the error's concrete value is assignable to
    the value pointed to by target, or if the error has a method As(any) bool
    such that As(target) returns true. In the latter case, the As method is
    responsible for setting target.

    An error type might provide an As method so it can be treated as if it were
    a different error type.

    As panics if target is not a non-nil pointer to either a type that
    implements error, or to any interface type.

func Is(err, target error) bool
    Is reports whether any error in err's tree matches target.

    The tree consists of err itself, followed by the errors obtained by
    repeatedly calling its Unwrap() error or Unwrap() []error method. When err
    wraps multiple errors, Is examines err followed by a depth-first traversal
    of its children.

    An error is considered to match a target if it is equal to that target or if
    it implements a method Is(error) bool such that Is(target) returns true.

    An error type might provide an Is method so it can be treated as equivalent
    to an existing error. For example, if MyError defines

        func (m MyError) Is(target error) bool { return target == fs.ErrExist }

    then Is(MyError{}, fs.ErrExist) returns true. See syscall.Errno.Is for an
    example in the standard library. An Is method should only shallowly compare
    err and the target and not call Unwrap on either.

func Join(errs ...error) error
    Join returns an error that wraps the given errors. Any nil error values are
    discarded. Join returns nil if every value in errs is nil. The error formats
    as the concatenation of the strings obtained by calling the Error method of
    each element of errs, with a newline between each string.

    A non-nil error returned by Join implements the Unwrap() []error method.

func New(text string) error
    New returns an error that formats as the given text. Each call to New
    returns a distinct error value even if the text is identical.

func Unwrap(err error) error
    Unwrap returns the result of calling the Unwrap method on err, if err's type
    contains an Unwrap method returning error. Otherwise, Unwrap returns nil.

    Unwrap only calls a method of the form "Unwrap() error". In particular
    Unwrap does not unwrap errors returned by Join.
