package io // import "io"

Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives. Its primary job is to
wrap existing implementations of such primitives, such as those in package os,
into shared public interfaces that abstract the functionality, plus some other
related primitives.

Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with various
implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not assume they are
safe for parallel execution.

CONSTANTS

const (
	SeekStart   = 0 // seek relative to the origin of the file
	SeekCurrent = 1 // seek relative to the current offset
	SeekEnd     = 2 // seek relative to the end
)
    Seek whence values.


VARIABLES

var EOF = errors.New("EOF")
    EOF is the error returned by Read when no more input is available. (Read
    must return EOF itself, not an error wrapping EOF, because callers will test
    for EOF using ==.) Functions should return EOF only to signal a graceful
    end of input. If the EOF occurs unexpectedly in a structured data stream,
    the appropriate error is either ErrUnexpectedEOF or some other error giving
    more detail.

var ErrClosedPipe = errors.New("io: read/write on closed pipe")
    ErrClosedPipe is the error used for read or write operations on a closed
    pipe.

var ErrNoProgress = errors.New("multiple Read calls return no data or error")
    ErrNoProgress is returned by some clients of a Reader when many calls to
    Read have failed to return any data or error, usually the sign of a broken
    Reader implementation.

var ErrShortBuffer = errors.New("short buffer")
    ErrShortBuffer means that a read required a longer buffer than was provided.

var ErrShortWrite = errors.New("short write")
    ErrShortWrite means that a write accepted fewer bytes than requested but
    failed to return an explicit error.

var ErrUnexpectedEOF = errors.New("unexpected EOF")
    ErrUnexpectedEOF means that EOF was encountered in the middle of reading a
    fixed-size block or data structure.


FUNCTIONS

func Copy(dst Writer, src Reader) (written int64, err error)
    Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached on src or an
    error occurs. It returns the number of bytes copied and the first error
    encountered while copying, if any.

    A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because Copy is
    defined to read from src until EOF, it does not treat an EOF from Read as an
    error to be reported.

    If src implements WriterTo, the copy is implemented by calling
    src.WriteTo(dst). Otherwise, if dst implements ReaderFrom, the copy is
    implemented by calling dst.ReadFrom(src).

func CopyBuffer(dst Writer, src Reader, buf []byte) (written int64, err error)
    CopyBuffer is identical to Copy except that it stages through the provided
    buffer (if one is required) rather than allocating a temporary one.
    If buf is nil, one is allocated; otherwise if it has zero length, CopyBuffer
    panics.

    If either src implements WriterTo or dst implements ReaderFrom, buf will not
    be used to perform the copy.

func CopyN(dst Writer, src Reader, n int64) (written int64, err error)
    CopyN copies n bytes (or until an error) from src to dst. It returns the
    number of bytes copied and the earliest error encountered while copying.
    On return, written == n if and only if err == nil.

    If dst implements ReaderFrom, the copy is implemented using it.

func Pipe() (*PipeReader, *PipeWriter)
    Pipe creates a synchronous in-memory pipe. It can be used to connect code
    expecting an io.Reader with code expecting an io.Writer.

    Reads and Writes on the pipe are matched one to one except when multiple
    Reads are needed to consume a single Write. That is, each Write to the
    PipeWriter blocks until it has satisfied one or more Reads from the
    PipeReader that fully consume the written data. The data is copied directly
    from the Write to the corresponding Read (or Reads); there is no internal
    buffering.

    It is safe to call Read and Write in parallel with each other or with Close.
    Parallel calls to Read and parallel calls to Write are also safe: the
    individual calls will be gated sequentially.

func ReadAll(r Reader) ([]byte, error)
    ReadAll reads from r until an error or EOF and returns the data it read.
    A successful call returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because ReadAll is
    defined to read from src until EOF, it does not treat an EOF from Read as an
    error to be reported.

func ReadAtLeast(r Reader, buf []byte, min int) (n int, err error)
    ReadAtLeast reads from r into buf until it has read at least min bytes.
    It returns the number of bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read.
    The error is EOF only if no bytes were read. If an EOF happens after
    reading fewer than min bytes, ReadAtLeast returns ErrUnexpectedEOF. If min
    is greater than the length of buf, ReadAtLeast returns ErrShortBuffer.
    On return, n >= min if and only if err == nil. If r returns an error having
    read at least min bytes, the error is dropped.

func ReadFull(r Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error)
    ReadFull reads exactly len(buf) bytes from r into buf. It returns the number
    of bytes copied and an error if fewer bytes were read. The error is EOF only
    if no bytes were read. If an EOF happens after reading some but not all the
    bytes, ReadFull returns ErrUnexpectedEOF. On return, n == len(buf) if and
    only if err == nil. If r returns an error having read at least len(buf)
    bytes, the error is dropped.

func WriteString(w Writer, s string) (n int, err error)
    WriteString writes the contents of the string s to w, which accepts a
    slice of bytes. If w implements StringWriter, [StringWriter.WriteString] is
    invoked directly. Otherwise, [Writer.Write] is called exactly once.


TYPES

type ByteReader interface {
	ReadByte() (byte, error)
}
    ByteReader is the interface that wraps the ReadByte method.

    ReadByte reads and returns the next byte from the input or any error
    encountered. If ReadByte returns an error, no input byte was consumed,
    and the returned byte value is undefined.

    ReadByte provides an efficient interface for byte-at-time processing.
    A Reader that does not implement ByteReader can be wrapped using
    bufio.NewReader to add this method.

type ByteScanner interface {
	ByteReader
	UnreadByte() error
}
    ByteScanner is the interface that adds the UnreadByte method to the basic
    ReadByte method.

    UnreadByte causes the next call to ReadByte to return the last byte read.
    If the last operation was not a successful call to ReadByte, UnreadByte
    may return an error, unread the last byte read (or the byte prior to the
    last-unread byte), or (in implementations that support the Seeker interface)
    seek to one byte before the current offset.

type ByteWriter interface {
	WriteByte(c byte) error
}
    ByteWriter is the interface that wraps the WriteByte method.

type Closer interface {
	Close() error
}
    Closer is the interface that wraps the basic Close method.

    The behavior of Close after the first call is undefined. Specific
    implementations may document their own behavior.

type LimitedReader struct {
	R Reader // underlying reader
	N int64  // max bytes remaining
}
    A LimitedReader reads from R but limits the amount of data returned to just
    N bytes. Each call to Read updates N to reflect the new amount remaining.
    Read returns EOF when N <= 0 or when the underlying R returns EOF.

func (l *LimitedReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)

type OffsetWriter struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    An OffsetWriter maps writes at offset base to offset base+off in the
    underlying writer.

func NewOffsetWriter(w WriterAt, off int64) *OffsetWriter
    NewOffsetWriter returns an OffsetWriter that writes to w starting at offset
    off.

func (o *OffsetWriter) Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error)

func (o *OffsetWriter) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)

func (o *OffsetWriter) WriteAt(p []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)

type PipeReader struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A PipeReader is the read half of a pipe.

func (r *PipeReader) Close() error
    Close closes the reader; subsequent writes to the write half of the pipe
    will return the error ErrClosedPipe.

func (r *PipeReader) CloseWithError(err error) error
    CloseWithError closes the reader; subsequent writes to the write half of the
    pipe will return the error err.

    CloseWithError never overwrites the previous error if it exists and always
    returns nil.

func (r *PipeReader) Read(data []byte) (n int, err error)
    Read implements the standard Read interface: it reads data from the pipe,
    blocking until a writer arrives or the write end is closed. If the write
    end is closed with an error, that error is returned as err; otherwise err is
    EOF.

type PipeWriter struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A PipeWriter is the write half of a pipe.

func (w *PipeWriter) Close() error
    Close closes the writer; subsequent reads from the read half of the pipe
    will return no bytes and EOF.

func (w *PipeWriter) CloseWithError(err error) error
    CloseWithError closes the writer; subsequent reads from the read half of the
    pipe will return no bytes and the error err, or EOF if err is nil.

    CloseWithError never overwrites the previous error if it exists and always
    returns nil.

func (w *PipeWriter) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error)
    Write implements the standard Write interface: it writes data to the pipe,
    blocking until one or more readers have consumed all the data or the read
    end is closed. If the read end is closed with an error, that err is returned
    as err; otherwise err is ErrClosedPipe.

type ReadCloser interface {
	Reader
	Closer
}
    ReadCloser is the interface that groups the basic Read and Close methods.

func NopCloser(r Reader) ReadCloser
    NopCloser returns a ReadCloser with a no-op Close method wrapping the
    provided Reader r. If r implements WriterTo, the returned ReadCloser will
    implement WriterTo by forwarding calls to r.

type ReadSeekCloser interface {
	Reader
	Seeker
	Closer
}
    ReadSeekCloser is the interface that groups the basic Read, Seek and Close
    methods.

type ReadSeeker interface {
	Reader
	Seeker
}
    ReadSeeker is the interface that groups the basic Read and Seek methods.

type ReadWriteCloser interface {
	Reader
	Writer
	Closer
}
    ReadWriteCloser is the interface that groups the basic Read, Write and Close
    methods.

type ReadWriteSeeker interface {
	Reader
	Writer
	Seeker
}
    ReadWriteSeeker is the interface that groups the basic Read, Write and Seek
    methods.

type ReadWriter interface {
	Reader
	Writer
}
    ReadWriter is the interface that groups the basic Read and Write methods.

type Reader interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
    Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.

    Read reads up to len(p) bytes into p. It returns the number of bytes read (0
    <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered. Even if Read returns n < len(p),
    it may use all of p as scratch space during the call. If some data is
    available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally returns what is
    available instead of waiting for more.

    When Read encounters an error or end-of-file condition after successfully
    reading n > 0 bytes, it returns the number of bytes read. It may return the
    (non-nil) error from the same call or return the error (and n == 0) from a
    subsequent call. An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning
    a non-zero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may return either
    err == EOF or err == nil. The next Read should return 0, EOF.

    Callers should always process the n > 0 bytes returned before considering
    the error err. Doing so correctly handles I/O errors that happen after
    reading some bytes and also both of the allowed EOF behaviors.

    If len(p) == 0, Read should always return n == 0. It may return a non-nil
    error if some error condition is known, such as EOF.

    Implementations of Read are discouraged from returning a zero byte count
    with a nil error, except when len(p) == 0. Callers should treat a return
    of 0 and nil as indicating that nothing happened; in particular it does not
    indicate EOF.

    Implementations must not retain p.

func LimitReader(r Reader, n int64) Reader
    LimitReader returns a Reader that reads from r but stops with EOF after n
    bytes. The underlying implementation is a *LimitedReader.

func MultiReader(readers ...Reader) Reader
    MultiReader returns a Reader that's the logical concatenation of the
    provided input readers. They're read sequentially. Once all inputs have
    returned EOF, Read will return EOF. If any of the readers return a non-nil,
    non-EOF error, Read will return that error.

func TeeReader(r Reader, w Writer) Reader
    TeeReader returns a Reader that writes to w what it reads from r. All reads
    from r performed through it are matched with corresponding writes to w.
    There is no internal buffering - the write must complete before the read
    completes. Any error encountered while writing is reported as a read error.

type ReaderAt interface {
	ReadAt(p []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)
}
    ReaderAt is the interface that wraps the basic ReadAt method.

    ReadAt reads len(p) bytes into p starting at offset off in the underlying
    input source. It returns the number of bytes read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any
    error encountered.

    When ReadAt returns n < len(p), it returns a non-nil error explaining why
    more bytes were not returned. In this respect, ReadAt is stricter than Read.

    Even if ReadAt returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch
    space during the call. If some data is available but not len(p) bytes,
    ReadAt blocks until either all the data is available or an error occurs.
    In this respect ReadAt is different from Read.

    If the n = len(p) bytes returned by ReadAt are at the end of the input
    source, ReadAt may return either err == EOF or err == nil.

    If ReadAt is reading from an input source with a seek offset, ReadAt should
    not affect nor be affected by the underlying seek offset.

    Clients of ReadAt can execute parallel ReadAt calls on the same input
    source.

    Implementations must not retain p.

type ReaderFrom interface {
	ReadFrom(r Reader) (n int64, err error)
}
    ReaderFrom is the interface that wraps the ReadFrom method.

    ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF or error. The return value n is the
    number of bytes read. Any error except EOF encountered during the read is
    also returned.

    The Copy function uses ReaderFrom if available.

type RuneReader interface {
	ReadRune() (r rune, size int, err error)
}
    RuneReader is the interface that wraps the ReadRune method.

    ReadRune reads a single encoded Unicode character and returns the rune and
    its size in bytes. If no character is available, err will be set.

type RuneScanner interface {
	RuneReader
	UnreadRune() error
}
    RuneScanner is the interface that adds the UnreadRune method to the basic
    ReadRune method.

    UnreadRune causes the next call to ReadRune to return the last rune read.
    If the last operation was not a successful call to ReadRune, UnreadRune
    may return an error, unread the last rune read (or the rune prior to the
    last-unread rune), or (in implementations that support the Seeker interface)
    seek to the start of the rune before the current offset.

type SectionReader struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    SectionReader implements Read, Seek, and ReadAt on a section of an
    underlying ReaderAt.

func NewSectionReader(r ReaderAt, off int64, n int64) *SectionReader
    NewSectionReader returns a SectionReader that reads from r starting at
    offset off and stops with EOF after n bytes.

func (s *SectionReader) Outer() (r ReaderAt, off int64, n int64)
    Outer returns the underlying ReaderAt and offsets for the section.

    The returned values are the same that were passed to NewSectionReader when
    the SectionReader was created.

func (s *SectionReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)

func (s *SectionReader) ReadAt(p []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)

func (s *SectionReader) Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error)

func (s *SectionReader) Size() int64
    Size returns the size of the section in bytes.

type Seeker interface {
	Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error)
}
    Seeker is the interface that wraps the basic Seek method.

    Seek sets the offset for the next Read or Write to offset, interpreted
    according to whence: SeekStart means relative to the start of the file,
    SeekCurrent means relative to the current offset, and SeekEnd means relative
    to the end (for example, offset = -2 specifies the penultimate byte of the
    file). Seek returns the new offset relative to the start of the file or an
    error, if any.

    Seeking to an offset before the start of the file is an error. Seeking
    to any positive offset may be allowed, but if the new offset exceeds the
    size of the underlying object the behavior of subsequent I/O operations is
    implementation-dependent.

type StringWriter interface {
	WriteString(s string) (n int, err error)
}
    StringWriter is the interface that wraps the WriteString method.

type WriteCloser interface {
	Writer
	Closer
}
    WriteCloser is the interface that groups the basic Write and Close methods.

type WriteSeeker interface {
	Writer
	Seeker
}
    WriteSeeker is the interface that groups the basic Write and Seek methods.

type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
    Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.

    Write writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream. It returns
    the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error
    encountered that caused the write to stop early. Write must return a non-nil
    error if it returns n < len(p). Write must not modify the slice data,
    even temporarily.

    Implementations must not retain p.

var Discard Writer = discard{}
    Discard is a Writer on which all Write calls succeed without doing anything.

func MultiWriter(writers ...Writer) Writer
    MultiWriter creates a writer that duplicates its writes to all the provided
    writers, similar to the Unix tee(1) command.

    Each write is written to each listed writer, one at a time. If a listed
    writer returns an error, that overall write operation stops and returns the
    error; it does not continue down the list.

type WriterAt interface {
	WriteAt(p []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)
}
    WriterAt is the interface that wraps the basic WriteAt method.

    WriteAt writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream at offset
    off. It returns the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p)) and
    any error encountered that caused the write to stop early. WriteAt must
    return a non-nil error if it returns n < len(p).

    If WriteAt is writing to a destination with a seek offset, WriteAt should
    not affect nor be affected by the underlying seek offset.

    Clients of WriteAt can execute parallel WriteAt calls on the same
    destination if the ranges do not overlap.

    Implementations must not retain p.

type WriterTo interface {
	WriteTo(w Writer) (n int64, err error)
}
    WriterTo is the interface that wraps the WriteTo method.

    WriteTo writes data to w until there's no more data to write or when an
    error occurs. The return value n is the number of bytes written. Any error
    encountered during the write is also returned.

    The Copy function uses WriterTo if available.
