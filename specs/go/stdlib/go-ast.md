## Description

https://github.com/willfaught[willfaught](https://github.com/willfaught)opened [on Jan 10, 2017](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18593#issue-199901952)Issue body actions

I don't see a way to insert documentation comments for file declarations such that they appear just above their decls after printing with go/printer.Fprint or go/format.Node (or both, as explained below). Is it impossible? If so, it should be noted in the doc; if not, it should be noted how to do it, since a straightforward mutation of the comment fields and/or creation/mutation/saving of a CommentMap for File.Comments doesn't work. Also note the related problems pointed out in the code below.

My scenario is writing a tool that inserts `// TODO` doc comments for undocumented exported decls.

```
var fs = token.NewFileSet()
var path = ... // path to .go file with exported decls with no doc
var af, _ = parser.ParseFile(fs, path, nil, parser.DeclarationErrors|parser.ParseComments)
var cm = ast.NewCommentMap(fs, af, af.Comments)

if cm == nil {
	cm = ast.CommentMap{} // problem: doc doesn't say cm can be nil! bug?
}

for _, d := range af.Decls {
	switch d := d.(type) {
	case *ast.FuncDecl:
		d.Doc = ... // insert doc

	case *ast.GenDecl:
		for _, s := range d.Specs {
			switch s := s.(type) {
			case *ast.TypeSpec:
				s.Doc = ... // insert doc

			case *ast.ValueSpec:
				s.Doc = ... // insert doc
			}
		}
	}
}

af.Comments = cm.Comments()

var b bytes.Buffer

format.Node(&b, fs, af) // problem: doesn't format new func doc comments! bug?

// func doc comments appear above their funcs correctly but replace blank line that was there before

bs, _ := format.Source(b.Bytes()) // format again for func doc comments

// var/const decl doc comments are put at the top of the file in one bunch
```
