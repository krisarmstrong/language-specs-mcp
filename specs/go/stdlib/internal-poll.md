package poll // import "internal/poll"

Package poll supports non-blocking I/O on file descriptors with polling.
This supports I/O operations that block only a goroutine, not a thread. This
is used by the net and os packages. It uses a poller built into the runtime,
with support from the runtime scheduler.

VARIABLES

var AcceptFunc func(int) (int, syscall.Sockaddr, error) = syscall.Accept
    AcceptFunc is used to hook the accept call.

var CloseFunc func(int) error = syscall.Close
    CloseFunc is used to hook the close call.

var ErrDeadlineExceeded error = &DeadlineExceededError{}
    ErrDeadlineExceeded is returned for an expired deadline. This is exported by
    the os package as os.ErrDeadlineExceeded.

var ErrFileClosing = errors.New("use of closed file")
    ErrFileClosing is returned when a file descriptor is used after it has been
    closed.

var ErrNetClosing = errNetClosing{}
    ErrNetClosing is returned when a network descriptor is used after it has
    been closed.

var ErrNoDeadline = errors.New("file type does not support deadline")
    ErrNoDeadline is returned when a request is made to set a deadline on a file
    type that does not use the poller.

var ErrNotPollable = errors.New("not pollable")
    ErrNotPollable is returned when the file or socket is not suitable for event
    notification.

var TestHookDidSendFile = func(dstFD *FD, src uintptr, written int64, err error, handled bool) {}
var TestHookDidWritev = func(wrote int) {}
    TestHookDidWritev is a hook for testing writev.


FUNCTIONS

func DupCloseOnExec(fd int) (int, string, error)
    DupCloseOnExec dups fd and marks it close-on-exec.

func IsPollDescriptor(fd uintptr) bool
    IsPollDescriptor reports whether fd is the descriptor being used by the
    poller. This is only used for testing.

    IsPollDescriptor should be an internal detail, but widely used packages
    access it using linkname. Notable members of the hall of shame include:
      - github.com/opencontainers/runc

    Do not remove or change the type signature. See go.dev/issue/67401.

func SendFile(dstFD *FD, src uintptr, size int64) (n int64, err error, handled bool)
    SendFile wraps the sendfile system call.

    It copies data from src (a file descriptor) to dstFD, starting at the
    current position of src. It updates the current position of src to after the
    copied data.

    If size is zero, it copies the rest of src. Otherwise, it copies up to size
    bytes.

    The handled return parameter indicates whether SendFile was able to handle
    some or all of the operation. If handled is false, sendfile was unable to
    perform the copy, has not modified the source or destination, and the caller
    should perform the copy using a fallback implementation.


TYPES

type DeadlineExceededError struct{}
    DeadlineExceededError is returned for an expired deadline.

func (e *DeadlineExceededError) Error() string
    Implement the net.Error interface. The string is "i/o timeout" because that
    is what was returned by earlier Go versions. Changing it may break programs
    that match on error strings.

func (e *DeadlineExceededError) Temporary() bool

func (e *DeadlineExceededError) Timeout() bool

type FD struct {

	// System file descriptor. Immutable until Close.
	Sysfd int

	// Platform dependent state of the file descriptor.
	SysFile

	// Whether this is a streaming descriptor, as opposed to a
	// packet-based descriptor like a UDP socket. Immutable.
	IsStream bool

	// Whether a zero byte read indicates EOF. This is false for a
	// message based socket connection.
	ZeroReadIsEOF bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    FD is a file descriptor. The net and os packages use this type as a field of
    a larger type representing a network connection or OS file.

func (fd *FD) Accept() (int, syscall.Sockaddr, string, error)
    Accept wraps the accept network call.

func (fd *FD) Close() error

    method when there are no remaining references.

func (fd *FD) Fsync() error

    be called multiple times on a single FD. The net argument is a network name
    from the net package (e.g., "tcp"), or "file". Set pollable to true if fd
    should be managed by runtime netpoll.

func (fd *FD) OpenDir() (uintptr, string, error)

type String string
    String is an internal string definition for methods/functions that is not
    intended for use outside the standard libraries.

    Other packages in std that import internal/poll and have some exported APIs
    (now we've got some in net.rawConn) which are only used internally and are
    not intended to be used outside the standard libraries, Therefore, we make
    those APIs use internal types like poll.FD or poll.String in their function
    signatures to disable the usability of these APIs from external codebase.

type SysFile struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
