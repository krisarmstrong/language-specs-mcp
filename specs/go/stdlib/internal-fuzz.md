package fuzz // import "internal/fuzz"

Package fuzz provides common fuzzing functionality for tests built with "go
test" and for programs that use fuzzing functionality in the testing package.

FUNCTIONS

func CheckCorpus(vals []any, types []reflect.Type) error
    CheckCorpus verifies that the types in vals match the expected types
    provided.

func CoordinateFuzzing(ctx context.Context, opts CoordinateFuzzingOpts) (err error)
    CoordinateFuzzing creates several worker processes and communicates with
    them to test random inputs that could trigger crashes and expose bugs.
    The worker processes run the same binary in the same directory with the same
    environment variables as the coordinator process. Workers also run with the
    same arguments as the coordinator, except with the -test.fuzzworker flag
    prepended to the argument list.

    If a crash occurs, the function will return an error containing information
    about the crash, which can be reported to the user.

func ResetCoverage()
    ResetCoverage sets all of the counters for each edge of the instrumented
    source code to 0.

func RunFuzzWorker(ctx context.Context, fn func(CorpusEntry) error) error
    RunFuzzWorker is called in a worker process to communicate with the
    coordinator process in order to fuzz random inputs. RunFuzzWorker loops
    until the coordinator tells it to stop.

    fn is a wrapper on the fuzz function. It may return an error to indicate
    a given input "crashed". The coordinator will also record a crasher if the
    function times out or terminates the process.

    RunFuzzWorker returns an error if it could not communicate with the
    coordinator process.

func SnapshotCoverage()
    SnapshotCoverage copies the current counter values into coverageSnapshot,
    preserving them for later inspection. SnapshotCoverage also rounds each
    counter down to the nearest power of two. This lets the coordinator store
    multiple values for each counter by OR'ing them together.


TYPES

type CoordinateFuzzingOpts struct {
	// Log is a writer for logging progress messages and warnings.
	// If nil, io.Discard will be used instead.
	Log io.Writer

	// Timeout is the amount of wall clock time to spend fuzzing after the corpus
	// has loaded. If zero, there will be no time limit.
	Timeout time.Duration

	// Limit is the number of random values to generate and test. If zero,
	// there will be no limit on the number of generated values.
	Limit int64

	// MinimizeTimeout is the amount of wall clock time to spend minimizing
	// after discovering a crasher. If zero, there will be no time limit. If
	// MinimizeTimeout and MinimizeLimit are both zero, then minimization will
	// be disabled.
	MinimizeTimeout time.Duration

	// MinimizeLimit is the maximum number of calls to the fuzz function to be
	// made while minimizing after finding a crash. If zero, there will be no
	// limit. Calls to the fuzz function made when minimizing also count toward
	// Limit. If MinimizeTimeout and MinimizeLimit are both zero, then
	// minimization will be disabled.
	MinimizeLimit int64

	// parallel is the number of worker processes to run in parallel. If zero,
	// CoordinateFuzzing will run GOMAXPROCS workers.
	Parallel int

	// Seed is a list of seed values added by the fuzz target with testing.F.Add
	// and in testdata.
	Seed []CorpusEntry

	// Types is the list of types which make up a corpus entry.
	// Types must be set and must match values in Seed.
	Types []reflect.Type

	// CorpusDir is a directory where files containing values that crash the
	// code being tested may be written. CorpusDir must be set.
	CorpusDir string

	// CacheDir is a directory containing additional "interesting" values.
	// The fuzzer may derive new values from these, and may write new values here.
	CacheDir string
}
    CoordinateFuzzingOpts is a set of arguments for CoordinateFuzzing. The zero
    value is valid for each field unless specified otherwise.

type CorpusEntry = struct {
	Parent string

	// Path is the path of the corpus file, if the entry was loaded from disk.
	// For other entries, including seed values provided by f.Add, Path is the
	// name of the test, e.g. seed#0 or its hash.
	Path string

	// Data is the raw input data. Data should only be populated for seed
	// values. For on-disk corpus files, Data will be nil, as it will be loaded
	// from disk using Path.
	Data []byte

	// Values is the unmarshaled values from a corpus file.
	Values []any

	Generation int

	// IsSeed indicates whether this entry is part of the seed corpus.
	IsSeed bool
}
    CorpusEntry represents an individual input for fuzzing.

    We must use an equivalent type in the testing and testing/internal/testdeps
    packages, but testing can't import this package directly, and we don't want
    to export this type from testing. Instead, we use the same struct type and
    use a type alias (not a defined type) for convenience.

func ReadCorpus(dir string, types []reflect.Type) ([]CorpusEntry, error)
    ReadCorpus reads the corpus from the provided dir. The returned corpus
    entries are guaranteed to match the given types. Any malformed files will
    be saved in a MalformedCorpusError and returned, along with the most recent
    error.

type MalformedCorpusError struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    MalformedCorpusError is an error found while reading the corpus from the
    filesystem. All of the errors are stored in the errs list. The testing
    framework uses this to report malformed files in testdata.

func (e *MalformedCorpusError) Error() string
