FUNCTIONS

func IsSystemGoroutine(entryFn string) bool
func MutatorUtilizationV2(events []Event, flags UtilFlags) [][]MutatorUtil
    MutatorUtilizationV2 returns a set of mutator utilization functions for the
    given v2 trace, passed as an io.Reader. Each function will always end with 0
    utilization. The bounds of each function are implicit in the first and last
    event; outside of these bounds each function is undefined.

    If the UtilPerProc flag is not given, this always returns a single
    utilization function. Otherwise, it returns one function per P.

func RelatedGoroutinesV2(events []Event, goid GoID) map[GoID]struct{}
    RelatedGoroutinesV2 finds a set of goroutines related to goroutine goid for
    v2 traces. The association is based on whether they have synchronized with
    each other in the Go scheduler (one has unblocked another).

	Trace Time

	// Wall is a snapshot of the system's wall clock.
	Wall time.Time

	// Mono is a snapshot of the system's monotonic clock.

}
    ClockSnapshot represents a near-simultaneous clock reading of several
    different system clocks. The snapshot can be used as a reference to convert

    with data captured by other tools.

type Event struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Event represents a single event in the trace.

func (e Event) Experimental() ExperimentalEvent
    Experimental returns a view of the raw event for an experimental event.

func (e Event) Goroutine() GoID
    Goroutine returns the ID of the goroutine that was executing when this event
    happened. It describes part of the execution context for this event.

    Note that for goroutine state transitions this always refers to the state
    before the transition. For example, if a goroutine is just starting
    to run on this thread and/or proc, then this will return NoGoroutine.
    In this case, the goroutine starting to run will be can be found at
    Event.StateTransition().Resource.

func (e Event) Kind() EventKind
    Kind returns the kind of event that this is.

func (e Event) Label() Label
    Label returns details about a Label event.

    Metric returns details about a Metric event.

    thread, then this will return NoProc.

func (e Event) Range() Range
    Range returns details about an EventRangeBegin, EventRangeActive,
    or EventRangeEnd event.

    Panics if Kind != EventRangeBegin, Kind != EventRangeActive, and Kind !=
    EventRangeEnd.

    RangeAttributes returns attributes for a completed range.

    Panics if Kind != EventRangeEnd.

    execution context.

func (e Event) Thread() ThreadID
    Thread returns the ID of the thread this event pertains to.

    Note that for thread state transitions this always refers to the state
    before the transition. For example, if a thread is just starting to run,
    then this will return NoThread.

    Note: tracking thread state is not currently supported, so this will always
    return a valid thread ID. However thread state transitions may be tracked in
    the future, and callers must be robust to this possibility.

	EventStackSample

	// EventRangeBegin and EventRangeEnd are a pair of generic events representing
	// a special range of time. Ranges are named and scoped to some resource
	// (identified via ResourceKind). A range that has begun but has not ended

	//
	// EvRangeBegin and EvRangeEnd will share the same name, and an End will always
	// follow a Begin on the same instance of the resource. The associated
	// resource ID can be obtained from the Event. ResourceNone indicates the
	// range is globally scoped. That is, any goroutine/proc/thread can start or
	// stop, but only one such range may be active at any given time.

    returns.

func (c *MMUCurve) MMU(window time.Duration) (mmu float64)

func (c *MMUCurve) MUD(window time.Duration, quantiles []float64) []float64
    MUD returns mutator utilization distribution quantiles for the given window
    size.

    The mutator utilization distribution is the distribution of mean mutator
    utilization across all windows of the given window size in the trace.

    The minimum mutator utilization is the minimum (0th percentile) of this
    distribution. (However, if only the minimum is desired, it's more efficient

	// Util is the mean mutator utilization starting at Time. This

}
    MutatorUtil is a change in mutator utilization at a particular time. Mutator

	// Event that produced these details. The corresponding RangeEnd will have
	// an identical name.
	Name string

	// Scope is the resource that the range is scoped to.
	//
	// For example, a ResourceGoroutine scope means that the same goroutine
	// must have a start and end for the range, and that goroutine can only
	// have one range of a particular name active at any given time. The
	// ID that this range is scoped to may be obtained via Event.Goroutine.
	//
	// The ResourceNone scope means that the range is globally scoped. As a
	// result, any goroutine/proc/thread may start or end the range, and only
	// one such named range may be active globally at any given time.
	//
	// For RangeBegin and RangeEnd events, this will always reference some
	// resource ID in the current execution context. For RangeActive events,
	// this may reference a resource not in the current context. Prefer Scope
	// over the current execution context.

	//
	// This is distinct from the result (Event).Stack because it pertains to
	// the transitioning resource, not any of the ones executing the event
	// this StateTransition came from.
	//
	// An example of this difference is the NotExist -> Runnable transition for
	// goroutines, which indicates goroutine creation. In this particular case,
	// a Stack here would refer to the starting stack of the new goroutine, and

    Proc returns the state transition for a proc.

    Transitions to and from states that are Executing are special in that they

type TaskID uint64
    TaskID is the internal ID of a task used to disambiguate tasks (even if they
    are of the same type).

type ThreadID int64
    ThreadID is the runtime-internal M structure's ID. This is unique for each
    OS thread.

type Time int64
    Time is a timestamp in nanoseconds.

    It corresponds to the monotonic clock on the platform that the trace was
    taken, and so is possible to correlate with timestamps for other traces
    taken on the same machine using the same clock (i.e. no reboots in between).

    The actual absolute value of the timestamp is only meaningful in relation to
    other timestamps from the same clock.

    BUG: Timestamps coming from traces on Windows platforms are only comparable
    with timestamps from the same trace. Timestamps across traces cannot be
    compared, because the system clock is not used as of Go 1.22.

    BUG: Traces produced by Go versions 1.21 and earlier cannot be compared with
    timestamps from other traces taken on the same machine. This is because the
    system clock was not used at all to collect those timestamps.

func (t Time) Sub(t0 Time) time.Duration
    Sub subtracts t0 from t, returning the duration in nanoseconds.

type UserRegionSummary struct {
	TaskID TaskID

    returned), and the transitive closure of all of its children.

type Value struct {

}
    Value is a dynamically-typed value obtained from a trace.

func (v Value) Kind() ValueKind
    Kind returns the ValueKind of the value.

    It represents the underlying structure of the value.

    New ValueKinds may be added in the future. Users of this type must be robust
    to that possibility.

func (v Value) String() string
    String returns the string value for a ValueString, and otherwise a string
    representation of the value for other kinds of values.

func (v Value) Uint64() uint64
    Uint64 returns the uint64 value for a ValueUint64.

    Panics if this Value's Kind is not ValueUint64.

type ValueKind uint8
    ValueKind is the type of a dynamically-typed value from a trace.

	ValueBad ValueKind = iota
	ValueUint64
