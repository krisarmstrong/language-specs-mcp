package bytes // import "bytes"

Package bytes implements functions for the manipulation of byte slices. It is
analogous to the facilities of the strings package.

CONSTANTS

const MinRead = 512
    MinRead is the minimum slice size passed to a Buffer.Read call by
    Buffer.ReadFrom. As long as the Buffer has at least MinRead bytes beyond
    what is required to hold the contents of r, Buffer.ReadFrom will not grow
    the underlying buffer.


VARIABLES

var ErrTooLarge = errors.New("bytes.Buffer: too large")
    ErrTooLarge is passed to panic if memory cannot be allocated to store data
    in a buffer.


FUNCTIONS

func Clone(b []byte) []byte
    Clone returns a copy of b[:len(b)]. The result may have additional unused
    capacity. Clone(nil) returns nil.

func Compare(a, b []byte) int
    Compare returns an integer comparing two byte slices lexicographically.
    The result will be 0 if a == b, -1 if a < b, and +1 if a > b. A nil argument
    is equivalent to an empty slice.

func Contains(b, subslice []byte) bool
    Contains reports whether subslice is within b.

func ContainsAny(b []byte, chars string) bool
    ContainsAny reports whether any of the UTF-8-encoded code points in chars
    are within b.

func ContainsFunc(b []byte, f func(rune) bool) bool
    ContainsFunc reports whether any of the UTF-8-encoded code points r within b
    satisfy f(r).

func ContainsRune(b []byte, r rune) bool
    ContainsRune reports whether the rune is contained in the UTF-8-encoded byte
    slice b.

func Count(s, sep []byte) int
    Count counts the number of non-overlapping instances of sep in s. If sep is
    an empty slice, Count returns 1 + the number of UTF-8-encoded code points in
    s.

func Cut(s, sep []byte) (before, after []byte, found bool)
    Cut slices s around the first instance of sep, returning the text before and
    after sep. The found result reports whether sep appears in s. If sep does
    not appear in s, cut returns s, nil, false.

    Cut returns slices of the original slice s, not copies.

func CutPrefix(s, prefix []byte) (after []byte, found bool)
    CutPrefix returns s without the provided leading prefix byte slice and
    reports whether it found the prefix. If s doesn't start with prefix,
    CutPrefix returns s, false. If prefix is the empty byte slice, CutPrefix
    returns s, true.

    CutPrefix returns slices of the original slice s, not copies.

func CutSuffix(s, suffix []byte) (before []byte, found bool)
    CutSuffix returns s without the provided ending suffix byte slice and
    reports whether it found the suffix. If s doesn't end with suffix, CutSuffix
    returns s, false. If suffix is the empty byte slice, CutSuffix returns s,
    true.

    CutSuffix returns slices of the original slice s, not copies.

func Equal(a, b []byte) bool
    Equal reports whether a and b are the same length and contain the same
    bytes. A nil argument is equivalent to an empty slice.

func EqualFold(s, t []byte) bool
    EqualFold reports whether s and t, interpreted as UTF-8 strings,
    are equal under simple Unicode case-folding, which is a more general form of
    case-insensitivity.

func Fields(s []byte) [][]byte
    Fields interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded code points. It splits
    the slice s around each instance of one or more consecutive white space
    characters, as defined by unicode.IsSpace, returning a slice of subslices
    of s or an empty slice if s contains only white space. Every element of
    the returned slice is non-empty. Unlike Split, leading and trailing runs of
    white space characters are discarded.

func FieldsFunc(s []byte, f func(rune) bool) [][]byte
    FieldsFunc interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded code points.
    It splits the slice s at each run of code points c satisfying f(c) and
    returns a slice of subslices of s. If all code points in s satisfy f(c),
    or len(s) == 0, an empty slice is returned. Every element of the returned
    slice is non-empty. Unlike [SplitFunc], leading and trailing runs of code
    points satisfying f(c) are discarded.

    FieldsFunc makes no guarantees about the order in which it calls f(c) and
    assumes that f always returns the same value for a given c.

func FieldsFuncSeq(s []byte, f func(rune) bool) iter.Seq[[]byte]
    FieldsFuncSeq returns an iterator over subslices of s split around runs of
    Unicode code points satisfying f(c). The iterator yields the same subslices
    that would be returned by FieldsFunc(s), but without constructing a new
    slice containing the subslices.

func FieldsSeq(s []byte) iter.Seq[[]byte]
    FieldsSeq returns an iterator over subslices of s split around runs of
    whitespace characters, as defined by unicode.IsSpace. The iterator yields
    the same subslices that would be returned by Fields(s), but without
    constructing a new slice containing the subslices.

func HasPrefix(s, prefix []byte) bool
    HasPrefix reports whether the byte slice s begins with prefix.

func HasSuffix(s, suffix []byte) bool
    HasSuffix reports whether the byte slice s ends with suffix.

func Index(s, sep []byte) int
    Index returns the index of the first instance of sep in s, or -1 if sep is
    not present in s.

func IndexAny(s []byte, chars string) int
    IndexAny interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points.
    It returns the byte index of the first occurrence in s of any of the Unicode
    code points in chars. It returns -1 if chars is empty or if there is no code
    point in common.

func IndexByte(b []byte, c byte) int
    IndexByte returns the index of the first instance of c in b, or -1 if c is
    not present in b.

func IndexFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) int
    IndexFunc interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded code points. It
    returns the byte index in s of the first Unicode code point satisfying f(c),
    or -1 if none do.

func IndexRune(s []byte, r rune) int
    IndexRune interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded code points.
    It returns the byte index of the first occurrence in s of the given rune.
    It returns -1 if rune is not present in s. If r is utf8.RuneError,
    it returns the first instance of any invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.

func Join(s [][]byte, sep []byte) []byte
    Join concatenates the elements of s to create a new byte slice. The
    separator sep is placed between elements in the resulting slice.

func LastIndex(s, sep []byte) int
    LastIndex returns the index of the last instance of sep in s, or -1 if sep
    is not present in s.

func LastIndexAny(s []byte, chars string) int
    LastIndexAny interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code
    points. It returns the byte index of the last occurrence in s of any of the
    Unicode code points in chars. It returns -1 if chars is empty or if there is
    no code point in common.

func LastIndexByte(s []byte, c byte) int
    LastIndexByte returns the index of the last instance of c in s, or -1 if c
    is not present in s.

func LastIndexFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) int
    LastIndexFunc interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded code points. It
    returns the byte index in s of the last Unicode code point satisfying f(c),
    or -1 if none do.

func Lines(s []byte) iter.Seq[[]byte]
    Lines returns an iterator over the newline-terminated lines in the byte
    slice s. The lines yielded by the iterator include their terminating
    newlines. If s is empty, the iterator yields no lines at all. If s does
    not end in a newline, the final yielded line will not end in a newline.
    It returns a single-use iterator.

func Map(mapping func(r rune) rune, s []byte) []byte
    Map returns a copy of the byte slice s with all its characters modified
    according to the mapping function. If mapping returns a negative value, the
    character is dropped from the byte slice with no replacement. The characters
    in s and the output are interpreted as UTF-8-encoded code points.

func Repeat(b []byte, count int) []byte
    Repeat returns a new byte slice consisting of count copies of b.

    It panics if count is negative or if the result of (len(b) * count)
    overflows.

func Replace(s, old, new []byte, n int) []byte
    Replace returns a copy of the slice s with the first n non-overlapping
    instances of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the
    beginning of the slice and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1
    replacements for a k-rune slice. If n < 0, there is no limit on the number
    of replacements.

func ReplaceAll(s, old, new []byte) []byte
    ReplaceAll returns a copy of the slice s with all non-overlapping instances
    of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the beginning of the
    slice and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1 replacements for a
    k-rune slice.

func Runes(s []byte) []rune
    Runes interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded code points. It returns a
    slice of runes (Unicode code points) equivalent to s.

func Split(s, sep []byte) [][]byte
    Split slices s into all subslices separated by sep and returns a slice of
    the subslices between those separators. If sep is empty, Split splits after
    each UTF-8 sequence. It is equivalent to SplitN with a count of -1.

    To split around the first instance of a separator, see Cut.

func SplitAfter(s, sep []byte) [][]byte
    SplitAfter slices s into all subslices after each instance of sep and
    returns a slice of those subslices. If sep is empty, SplitAfter splits after
    each UTF-8 sequence. It is equivalent to SplitAfterN with a count of -1.

func SplitAfterN(s, sep []byte, n int) [][]byte
    SplitAfterN slices s into subslices after each instance of sep and returns
    a slice of those subslices. If sep is empty, SplitAfterN splits after each
    UTF-8 sequence. The count determines the number of subslices to return:
      - n > 0: at most n subslices; the last subslice will be the unsplit
        remainder;
      - n == 0: the result is nil (zero subslices);
      - n < 0: all subslices.

func SplitAfterSeq(s, sep []byte) iter.Seq[[]byte]
    SplitAfterSeq returns an iterator over subslices of s split after each
    instance of sep. The iterator yields the same subslices that would be
    returned by SplitAfter(s, sep), but without constructing a new slice
    containing the subslices. It returns a single-use iterator.

func SplitN(s, sep []byte, n int) [][]byte
    SplitN slices s into subslices separated by sep and returns a slice of the
    subslices between those separators. If sep is empty, SplitN splits after
    each UTF-8 sequence. The count determines the number of subslices to return:
      - n > 0: at most n subslices; the last subslice will be the unsplit
        remainder;
      - n == 0: the result is nil (zero subslices);
      - n < 0: all subslices.

    To split around the first instance of a separator, see Cut.

func SplitSeq(s, sep []byte) iter.Seq[[]byte]
    SplitSeq returns an iterator over all subslices of s separated by sep.
    The iterator yields the same subslices that would be returned by Split(s,
    sep), but without constructing a new slice containing the subslices.
    It returns a single-use iterator.

func Title(s []byte) []byte
    Title treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a copy with all Unicode
    letters that begin words mapped to their title case.

    Deprecated: The rule Title uses for word boundaries does not handle Unicode
    punctuation properly. Use golang.org/x/text/cases instead.

func ToLower(s []byte) []byte
    ToLower returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped
    to their lower case.

func ToLowerSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s []byte) []byte
    ToLowerSpecial treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a copy with
    all the Unicode letters mapped to their lower case, giving priority to the
    special casing rules.

func ToTitle(s []byte) []byte
    ToTitle treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a copy with all the
    Unicode letters mapped to their title case.

func ToTitleSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s []byte) []byte
    ToTitleSpecial treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a copy with
    all the Unicode letters mapped to their title case, giving priority to the
    special casing rules.

func ToUpper(s []byte) []byte
    ToUpper returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped
    to their upper case.

func ToUpperSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s []byte) []byte
    ToUpperSpecial treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a copy with
    all the Unicode letters mapped to their upper case, giving priority to the
    special casing rules.

func ToValidUTF8(s, replacement []byte) []byte
    ToValidUTF8 treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a copy with each run
    of bytes representing invalid UTF-8 replaced with the bytes in replacement,
    which may be empty.

func Trim(s []byte, cutset string) []byte
    Trim returns a subslice of s by slicing off all leading and trailing
    UTF-8-encoded code points contained in cutset.

func TrimFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) []byte
    TrimFunc returns a subslice of s by slicing off all leading and trailing
    UTF-8-encoded code points c that satisfy f(c).

func TrimLeft(s []byte, cutset string) []byte
    TrimLeft returns a subslice of s by slicing off all leading UTF-8-encoded
    code points contained in cutset.

func TrimLeftFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) []byte
    TrimLeftFunc treats s as UTF-8-encoded bytes and returns a subslice of s by
    slicing off all leading UTF-8-encoded code points c that satisfy f(c).

func TrimPrefix(s, prefix []byte) []byte
    TrimPrefix returns s without the provided leading prefix string. If s
    doesn't start with prefix, s is returned unchanged.

func TrimRight(s []byte, cutset string) []byte

    code points that are contained in cutset.

func TrimRightFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) []byte

    white space, as defined by Unicode.

func TrimSuffix(s, suffix []byte) []byte
    TrimSuffix returns s without the provided trailing suffix string. If s
    doesn't end with suffix, s is returned unchanged.


TYPES

type Buffer struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Buffer.Read and
    Buffer.Write methods. The zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to
    use.

func NewBuffer(buf []byte) *Buffer
    NewBuffer creates and initializes a new Buffer using buf as its initial
    contents. The new Buffer takes ownership of buf, and the caller should not
    use buf after this call. NewBuffer is intended to prepare a Buffer to read
    existing data. It can also be used to set the initial size of the internal
    buffer for writing. To do that, buf should have the desired capacity but a
    length of zero.

    In most cases, new(Buffer) (or just declaring a Buffer variable) is
    sufficient to initialize a Buffer.

func NewBufferString(s string) *Buffer
    NewBufferString creates and initializes a new Buffer using string s as its
    initial contents. It is intended to prepare a buffer to read an existing
    string.

    In most cases, new(Buffer) (or just declaring a Buffer variable) is
    sufficient to initialize a Buffer.

func (b *Buffer) Available() int
    Available returns how many bytes are unused in the buffer.

func (b *Buffer) AvailableBuffer() []byte
    AvailableBuffer returns an empty buffer with b.Available() capacity. This
    buffer is intended to be appended to and passed to an immediately succeeding
    Buffer.Write call. The buffer is only valid until the next write operation
    on b.

func (b *Buffer) Bytes() []byte
    Bytes returns a slice of length b.Len() holding the unread portion of the
    buffer. The slice is valid for use only until the next buffer modification
    (that is, only until the next call to a method like Buffer.Read,
    Buffer.Write, Buffer.Reset, or Buffer.Truncate). The slice aliases the
    buffer content at least until the next buffer modification, so immediate
    changes to the slice will affect the result of future reads.

func (b *Buffer) Cap() int
    Cap returns the capacity of the buffer's underlying byte slice, that is,
    the total space allocated for the buffer's data.

func (b *Buffer) Grow(n int)
    Grow grows the buffer's capacity, if necessary, to guarantee space for
    another n bytes. After Grow(n), at least n bytes can be written to the
    buffer without another allocation. If n is negative, Grow will panic.
    If the buffer can't grow it will panic with ErrTooLarge.

func (b *Buffer) Len() int
    Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the buffer; b.Len()
    == len(b.Bytes()).

func (b *Buffer) Next(n int) []byte
    Next returns a slice containing the next n bytes from the buffer,
    advancing the buffer as if the bytes had been returned by Buffer.Read. If
    there are fewer than n bytes in the buffer, Next returns the entire buffer.
    The slice is only valid until the next call to a read or write method.

func (b *Buffer) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    Read reads the next len(p) bytes from the buffer or until the buffer is
    drained. The return value n is the number of bytes read. If the buffer has
    no data to return, err is io.EOF (unless len(p) is zero); otherwise it is
    nil.

func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error)
    ReadByte reads and returns the next byte from the buffer. If no byte is
    available, it returns error io.EOF.

func (b *Buffer) ReadBytes(delim byte) (line []byte, err error)
    ReadBytes reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input,
    returning a slice containing the data up to and including the delimiter.
    If ReadBytes encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns the
    data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF). ReadBytes
    returns err != nil if and only if the returned data does not end in delim.

func (b *Buffer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error)
    ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF and appends it to the buffer, growing
    the buffer as needed. The return value n is the number of bytes read.
    Any error except io.EOF encountered during the read is also returned.
    If the buffer becomes too large, ReadFrom will panic with ErrTooLarge.

func (b *Buffer) ReadRune() (r rune, size int, err error)
    ReadRune reads and returns the next UTF-8-encoded Unicode code point from
    the buffer. If no bytes are available, the error returned is io.EOF. If the
    bytes are an erroneous UTF-8 encoding, it consumes one byte and returns
    U+FFFD, 1.

func (b *Buffer) ReadString(delim byte) (line string, err error)
    ReadString reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input,
    returning a string containing the data up to and including the delimiter.
    If ReadString encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns the
    data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF). ReadString
    returns err != nil if and only if the returned data does not end in delim.

func (b *Buffer) Reset()
    Reset resets the buffer to be empty, but it retains the underlying storage
    for use by future writes. Reset is the same as Buffer.Truncate(0).

func (b *Buffer) String() string
    String returns the contents of the unread portion of the buffer as a string.
    If the Buffer is a nil pointer, it returns "<nil>".

    To build strings more efficiently, see the strings.Builder type.

func (b *Buffer) Truncate(n int)
    Truncate discards all but the first n unread bytes from the buffer but
    continues to use the same allocated storage. It panics if n is negative or
    greater than the length of the buffer.

func (b *Buffer) UnreadByte() error
    UnreadByte unreads the last byte returned by the most recent successful
    read operation that read at least one byte. If a write has happened since
    the last read, if the last read returned an error, or if the read read zero
    bytes, UnreadByte returns an error.

func (b *Buffer) UnreadRune() error
    UnreadRune unreads the last rune returned by Buffer.ReadRune. If the
    most recent read or write operation on the buffer was not a successful
    Buffer.ReadRune, UnreadRune returns an error. (In this regard it is stricter
    than Buffer.UnreadByte, which will unread the last byte from any read
    operation.)

func (b *Buffer) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    Write appends the contents of p to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed.
    The return value n is the length of p; err is always nil. If the buffer
    becomes too large, Write will panic with ErrTooLarge.

func (b *Buffer) WriteByte(c byte) error
    WriteByte appends the byte c to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed.
    The returned error is always nil, but is included to match bufio.Writer's
    WriteByte. If the buffer becomes too large, WriteByte will panic with
    ErrTooLarge.

func (b *Buffer) WriteRune(r rune) (n int, err error)
    WriteRune appends the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode code point r to the buffer,
    returning its length and an error, which is always nil but is included to
    match bufio.Writer's WriteRune. The buffer is grown as needed; if it becomes
    too large, WriteRune will panic with ErrTooLarge.

func (b *Buffer) WriteString(s string) (n int, err error)
    WriteString appends the contents of s to the buffer, growing the buffer as
    needed. The return value n is the length of s; err is always nil. If the
    buffer becomes too large, WriteString will panic with ErrTooLarge.

func (b *Buffer) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64, err error)
    WriteTo writes data to w until the buffer is drained or an error occurs. The
    return value n is the number of bytes written; it always fits into an int,
    but it is int64 to match the io.WriterTo interface. Any error encountered
    during the write is also returned.

type Reader struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Reader implements the io.Reader, io.ReaderAt, io.WriterTo, io.Seeker,
    io.ByteScanner, and io.RuneScanner interfaces by reading from a byte slice.
    Unlike a Buffer, a Reader is read-only and supports seeking. The zero value
    for Reader operates like a Reader of an empty slice.

func NewReader(b []byte) *Reader
    NewReader returns a new Reader reading from b.

func (r *Reader) Len() int
    Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the slice.

func (r *Reader) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)
    Read implements the io.Reader interface.

func (r *Reader) ReadAt(b []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)
    ReadAt implements the io.ReaderAt interface.

func (r *Reader) ReadByte() (byte, error)
    ReadByte implements the io.ByteReader interface.

func (r *Reader) ReadRune() (ch rune, size int, err error)
    ReadRune implements the io.RuneReader interface.

func (r *Reader) Reset(b []byte)
    Reset resets the Reader to be reading from b.

func (r *Reader) Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error)
    Seek implements the io.Seeker interface.

func (r *Reader) Size() int64
    Size returns the original length of the underlying byte slice. Size is
    the number of bytes available for reading via Reader.ReadAt. The result is
    unaffected by any method calls except Reader.Reset.

func (r *Reader) UnreadByte() error
    UnreadByte complements Reader.ReadByte in implementing the io.ByteScanner
    interface.

func (r *Reader) UnreadRune() error
    UnreadRune complements Reader.ReadRune in implementing the io.RuneScanner
    interface.

func (r *Reader) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64, err error)
    WriteTo implements the io.WriterTo interface.
