# Archiving repositories

You can archive a repository to make it read-only for all users and indicate that it's no longer actively maintained. You can also unarchive repositories that have been archived.

## In this article

- [About repository archival](#about-repository-archival)
- [Archiving a repository](#archiving-a-repository)
- [Unarchiving a repository](#unarchiving-a-repository)

## [About repository archival](#about-repository-archival)

Note

 If you have a legacy per-repository billing plan, you will still be charged for your archived repository. If you don't want to be charged for an archived repository, you must upgrade to a new product. For more information, see [GitHub’s plans](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).

Note

 Customers who use GitHub Secret Protection can enable secret scanning on archived repositories. For more information, see [About secret scanning](/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning).

We recommend that you close all issues and pull requests, as well as update the README file and description, before you archive a repository.

Once a repository is archived, you cannot add or remove collaborators or teams. Contributors with access to the repository can only fork or star your project.

When a repository is archived, its issues, pull requests, code, labels, milestones, projects, wiki, releases, commits, tags, branches, reactions, code scanning alerts, comments and permissions become read-only. To make changes in an archived repository, you must unarchive the repository first.

You can search for archived repositories. For more information, see [Searching for repositories](/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories#search-based-on-whether-a-repository-is-archived). You can also search for issues and pull requests within archived repositories. For more information, see [Searching issues and pull requests](/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-based-on-whether-a-repository-is-archived).

To archive all repositories in an organization at once, you can archive the entire organization. For more information, see [Archiving an organization](/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/archiving-an-organization).
