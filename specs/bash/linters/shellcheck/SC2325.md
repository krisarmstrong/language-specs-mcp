## Multiple ! in front of pipelines are a bash/ksh extension. Use only 0 or 1.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2! ! true
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2true
```

### Rationale:

POSIX (and Dash) does not allow multiple `!` pipeline negations in a row. It's also logically unnecessary.

Use either zero or one `!`.

### Exceptions:

Scripts whose shebang declares it will run with Ksh and Bash will not trigger this warning.

If you really want to negate multiple times on POSIX or Dash, e.g. to normalize exit codes to 0 or 1, use `cmd || false` or a command group:

```
#cb3-1! { ! true; } 
```
