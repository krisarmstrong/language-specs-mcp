# Useless cat. Consider `cmd < file | ..` or `cmd file | ..` instead.

### Optional - `useless-use-of-cat`

This is an [optional](optional) rule, which means that it has a special "long name" and is not enabled by default. See the [optional](optional) page for more details. In short, you have to enable it with the long name instead of the "SC" code like you would with a normal rule:

#### `.shellcheckrc`

```
enable=useless-use-of-cat # SC2002
```

(Note that this check was not optional prior to version 0.11.0.)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb2-1cat file | tr ' ' _ | nl
#cb2-2cat file | while IFS= read -r i; do echo "${i%?}"; done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1< file tr ' ' _ | nl  
#cb3-2while IFS= read -r i; do echo "${i%?}"; done < file
```

### Rationale:

`cat` is a tool for con"cat"enating files. Reading a single file as input to a program is considered a [Useless
Use Of Cat (UUOC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)#Useless_use_of_cat).

It's more efficient and less roundabout to simply use redirection. This is especially true for programs that can benefit from seekable input, like `tail` or `tar`.

Many tools also accept optional filenames, e.g. `grep -q foo file` instead of `cat file | grep -q foo`.

### Exceptions

Pointing out UUOC is a long standing shell programming tradition, and removing them from a short-lived pipeline in a loop can speed it up by 2x. However, it's not necessarily a good use of time in practice, and rarely affects correctness. [Ignore](Ignore) as you see fit.
