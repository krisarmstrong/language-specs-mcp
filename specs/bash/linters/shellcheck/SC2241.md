## The exit status can only be one integer 0-255. Use stdout for other data.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1exit foo bar
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo foo
#cb2-2echo bar
#cb2-3exit
```

### Rationale:

In bash, `exit` can only be used to signal success or failure (0 = success, 1-255 = failure).

To exit with textual or multiple values from a function, write them to stdout and capture them with command substitution instead.

See [SC2242](SC2242) for more information.

### Exceptions:

None
