## Use `false` instead of empty `[`/`[[` conditionals.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Temporarily disabled"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if false
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Temporarily disabled"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

`[ ]` is a somewhat obscure way of expressing falsehood, and the behavior is likely intended to allow the incorrectly quoted command `[ $var ]` to still work when the variable is unset.

POSIX has a more descriptive command `false` for this.

### Exceptions:

None. This is a stylistic suggestion, and has no effect on how the script works.
