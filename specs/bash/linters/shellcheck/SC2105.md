## `break` is only valid in loops

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1case "$1" in
#cb1-2    -v)
#cb1-3       verbose=1
#cb1-4       break
#cb1-5       ;;
#cb1-6    -d)
#cb1-7       debug=1
#cb1-8esac
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1case "$1" in
#cb2-2    -v)
#cb2-3       verbose=1
#cb2-4       ;;
#cb2-5    -d)
#cb2-6       debug=1
#cb2-7esac
```

### Rationale:

`break` or `continue` was found outside a loop. These statements are valid only in loops. In particular, `break` is not required in `case` statements as there is no implicit fall-through.

To return from a function or sourced script, use `return`. To exit a script, use `exit`.

### Exceptions:

It's possible to `break`/`continue` in a function without a loop. The call will then affect the loop – if any – that the function is invoked from, but this is obviously not good coding practice.
