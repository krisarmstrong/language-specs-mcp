## In POSIX `sh`, brace expansion is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2
#cb1-3for i in {1..5}; do ...
```

Here, `$i` expands to `{1..5}`. It does not expand to the sequence `1 2 3 4 5`

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2i=1
#cb2-3# while $i ≤ 5 ...
#cb2-4while [ "${i}" -le 5 ]; do ...
#cb2-5
#cb2-6  # something that will occur 5 times
#cb2-7
#cb2-8  i=$((i + 1))
#cb2-9done
```

You can also use the `seq` command, e.g. `seq 1 5`, but `seq` is not a POSIX utility.

### Rationale:

### Exceptions:

None
