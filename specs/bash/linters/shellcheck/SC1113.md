## Use `#!`, not just `#`, for the shebang.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1# /bin/bash
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#! /bin/bash
#cb2-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be specifying a shebang, but missing the bang (i.e. `!`). The shebang should always be on the form `#!/path/shell`.

### Exceptions:

None.
