## Couldn't find end token `EOF` in the here document.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1cat << EOF
#cb1-2  Hello World
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1cat << EOF
#cb2-2  Hello World
#cb2-3EOF
```

### Rationale:

The `<<` here document (aka heredoc) was not properly terminated. The terminating token needs to be on a separate line without indenting (or indented with tabs only when using `<<-`).

Note that you can not put here documents in one liners. For such use cases, use a `<<<` here string:

```
#cb3-1cat << EOF  hello world  EOF   # Wrong: data and terminator can not be on the same line
#cb3-2cat <<< "hello world"          # Correct
```

### Exceptions:

None
