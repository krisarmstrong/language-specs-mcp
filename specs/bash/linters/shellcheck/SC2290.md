## Remove spaces around = to assign.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1export LC_ALL = "POSIX"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1export LC_ALL="POSIX"
```

### Rationale:

Parameters to `export`, `declare`, `local`, `typeset` and `readonly` may not have spaces around the `=` or `+=` operator. This is the same as for regular variable assignments:

```
export var = value   # Invalid: spaces around =
export var =value    # Invalid: space before =
export var= value    # Invalid: space after =
export var=value     # Valid
```

This is because each individual argument to these commands is interpreted as a string in the format `name=value`. By adding spaces, you are instead passing the three strings `var`, `=`, `value`, none of which follow this format.

### Exceptions:

None
