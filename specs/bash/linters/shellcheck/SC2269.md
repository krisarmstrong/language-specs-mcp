## This variable is assigned to itself, so the assignment does nothing.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var="$var"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# If the goal is to do nothing
#cb2-2true
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a variable that is assigned to itself, e.g. `x=$x`. This obviously has no effect.

Double check what the assignment was supposed to do.

### Exceptions:

None.
