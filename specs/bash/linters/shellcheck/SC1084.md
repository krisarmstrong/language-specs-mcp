## Use `#!`, not `!#`, for the shebang.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1!#/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

The shebang has been accidentally swapped. The `#` should come first: `#!`, not `!#`.

### Exceptions

None.
