## You need `\` before line feeds to break lines in `[ ]`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[ "$filename" =
#cb1-2  "$otherfile" ]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[ "$filename" = \
#cb2-2  "$otherfile" ]
```

### Rationale:

Bash/ksh `[[ ]]]` can include line breaks anywhere, but `[ ]` requires that you escape them. If you are writing a multi-line `[ .. ]` statement, make sure to include these escapes. If the `[ ]` is supposed to be on a single line, make sure the `]` is there.

### Exceptions:

None
