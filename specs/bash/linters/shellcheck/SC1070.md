## Parsing stopped here. Mismatched keywords or invalid parentheses?

### Rationale

ShellCheck found a syntax error at the indicated location. Barring a bug in ShellCheck itself, your shell will also crash with a syntax error at the same location, so you cannot ignore this check.

### Exceptions

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
