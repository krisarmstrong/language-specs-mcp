## Semicolons directly after `else` are not allowed. Just remove it.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if mycommand; then echo "True"; else; echo "False"; fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if mycommand; then echo "True"; else echo "False"; fi
```

### Rationale:

`else` keywords should not be followed by semicolons. It's not valid shell syntax.

You can follow them directly with a line break or another command.

### Exceptions:

None
