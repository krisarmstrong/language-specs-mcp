## Escaping `\<` is required in `[..]`, but invalid in `[..](..)`

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ aardvark \< zebra ]]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[[ aardvark < zebra ]]
```

### Rationale:

Grammatically speaking, `[` is considered a normal command name, so `<` and `>` are interpreted as redirections. When using the lexicographical string operators `<` and `>` in `[ .. ]`, they must be escaped (e.g. `\<` or `"<"`).

`[[` is considered its own grammatical construct, and therefore it does not require (nor does it allow) escaping `<` or `>`.

### Exceptions:

None
