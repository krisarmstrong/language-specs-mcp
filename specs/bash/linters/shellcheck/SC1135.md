## Prefer escape over ending quote to make `$` literal. Instead of `"It costs $"5`, use `"It costs \$5"`

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo "The apples are $""1 each"
#cb1-2eval "var=$"name
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "The apples are \$1 each"
#cb2-2eval "var=\$name"
#cb2-3# or better yet: var="${!name}"
```

### Rationale:

The script appears to be closing a double quoted string for the sole purpose of making a dollar sign `$` literal.

While this happens to work, the better solution is instead to escape it with a backslash. This allows the double quoted string to continue uninterrupted, thereby reducing the visual noise of stopping and starting quotes in the middle of a shell word.

### Exceptions:

None
