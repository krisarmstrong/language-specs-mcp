## Missing second `(` to start arithmetic for ((;;)) loop

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for (i=0; i<10; i++))
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  echo $i
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  echo $i
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an arithmetic `for ((;;))` expression where either the `((` or the `))` did not come as a pair. Make sure to use `(( ))` and not `( )`.

### Exceptions:

None.
