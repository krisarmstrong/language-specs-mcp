## Use `#!`, not just `!`, for the shebang.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "Hello"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "Hello"
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be specifying an interpreter in a shebang, but it's missing the hash part. The shebang must always start with `#!`.

Even the name "shebang" itself comes from "hash" (`#`) + "bang" (`!`).

### Exceptions:

None.
