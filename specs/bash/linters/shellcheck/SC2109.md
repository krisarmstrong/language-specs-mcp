## Instead of `[ a || b ]`, use `[ a ] || [ b ]`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[ "$1" = "-v" || "$1" = "-help" ]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[ "$1" = "-v" ] || [ "$1" = "-help" ]
```

### Rationale:

`||` cannot be used in a `[ .. ]` test expression. Instead, make two `[ .. ]` expressions and put the `||` between them.

### Exceptions:

None.
