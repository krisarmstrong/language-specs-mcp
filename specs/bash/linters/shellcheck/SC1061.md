## Couldn't find `done` for this `do`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1yes() {
#cb1-2  while echo "y"
#cb1-3  do
#cb1-4    true
#cb1-5}
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1yes() {
#cb2-2  while echo "y"
#cb2-3  do
#cb2-4    true
#cb2-5  done
#cb2-6}
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `do` without a corresponding `done`.

Double check that the `done` exists, and that it correctly matches the indicated `do`. A companion warning [SC1062](SC1062) is emitted where ShellCheck first noticed it was missing.

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
