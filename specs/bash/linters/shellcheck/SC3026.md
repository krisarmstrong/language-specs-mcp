## In POSIX sh, `^` in place of `!` in glob bracket expressions is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo foo-[^0]*.jpg
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo foo-[!0]*.jpg
```

or if the intention is to match `^` literally then either do not put it immediately after `[` or quote it by backslash `\`

```
#cb3-1echo foo-[0^]*.jpg foo-[\^0]*.jpg
```

### Rationale:

`[^c]` is frequently used in most regular expression variants to mean "any character except `c`". Ksh and Bash adopted it for globs as well.

However, strictly speaking, the only range complement syntax guaranteed to be supported across shells is `[!c]`. POSIX explicitly states that behavior of `[^c]` is unspecified. Dash used to support `[^c]` when compiled with `fnmatch` and `glob` from glibc, but it was considered as a [bug](https://lore.kernel.org/dash/09fd70edcf08c75b4f9f2e158e3e6c0832d35d90.camel@scientia.org/t/#u) and fixed in version 0.5.12. Busybox has a similar [bug 14516](https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=14516).

In zsh interactive sessions `echo foo-[!0]*.jpg` may cause `zsh: event not found: 0` error due to attempt of history expansion. BASH however suppresses history expansion when `!` is first character in square brackets.

Discrepancy of negation syntax in regular expressions and shell pattern matching appeared in early UNIX versions. Pipeline syntax in shells had not settled yet, some terminals had no `|` key, so `^` was used there. That is why in some shells exclamation mark `!` was chosen instead of circumflex (caret) `^` symbol for negation in globs. For more details related to shell history see ["The
^ = | ?" thread](https://inbox.vuxu.org/tuhs/20030126014003.GA3818@sydney.worldwide.lemis.com/T/#u) in the Unix Heritage Society mailing list or [Sven Mascheck. The
Traditional Bourne Shell Family. History and Development](https://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/) page.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning. Or just rewrite it to be on the technically correct side.
