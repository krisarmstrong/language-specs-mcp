## Unexpected `==`. For assignment, use `=`. For comparison, use `[`/`[[`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var==value
```

### Correct code:

Assignment:

```
#cb2-1var=value
```

Comparison:

```
#cb3-1[ "$var" = value ]
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has noticed that you're using `==` in an unexpected way. The two most common reasons for this is:

- 

You wanted to assign a value but accidentally used `==` instead of `=`.

- 

You wanted to compare two values, but neglected to use `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]`.

### Exceptions:

If you wanted to assign a literal equals sign, use quotes to make this clear:

```
#cb4-1var="=sum(A1:A10)"
```
