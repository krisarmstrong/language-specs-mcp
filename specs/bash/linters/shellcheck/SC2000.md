# See if you can use `${#variable}` instead

`${#variable}` will be equal to the number of characters in `"${variable}"`

This is the same result as `"$( echo "$variable" | wc -m )"` When "$variable" only contains single-byte characters, it's also the same as `"$( echo "$variable" | wc -c )"`

## example code

```
#cb1-1#!/usr/bin/env  bash
#cb1-2
#cb1-3if [ "$( echo "$1" | wc -c )" -gt 1 ]; then
#cb1-4  echo "greater than 1"
#cb1-5fi
#cb1-6
#cb1-7if [ "$( echo "$1" | wc -m )" -gt 1 ]; then
#cb1-8  echo "greater than 1"
#cb1-9fi
#cb1-10
#cb1-11if [ "${#1}" -gt 1 ]; then
#cb1-12  echo "greater than 1"
#cb1-13fi
```
