## You probably wanted || here, otherwise it's always false.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [[ $answer == yes && $answer = auto ]]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Feature Enabled"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [[ $answer == yes || $answer = auto ]]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Feature Enabled"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

The problematic condition will never trigger because of a logic error.

In English one think say "I want to check for the answers `yes` and `auto`", but the test ends up checking that the answer is both "yes" and "auto" at the same time, which it can't be (if the answer is "yes", it's necessarily not "auto", and vice versa).

The correct check is "if the answer is `yes` or if the answer is `auto`", which will be true if the user enters either "yes" or "auto".

### Exceptions:

None
