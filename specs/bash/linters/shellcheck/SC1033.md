## Test expression was opened with double `[[` but closed with single `]`. Make sure they match.

(or [SC1034](SC1034) for vice versa)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ -z "$var" ]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[[ -z "$var" ]]
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a test expression `[ ... ]` (POSIX) or `[[ ... ]]` (ksh/bash), but where the opening and closing brackets did not match (i.e. `[[ .. ]` or `[ .. ]]`). The brackets need to match up to work.

Note in particular that `[..]` do not work like parentheses in other languages. You can not do:

```
#cb3-1# Invalid
#cb3-2[[ x ] || [ y ]]
```

You would instead use two separate test expressions joined by `||`:

```
#cb4-1# Valid basic test expressions (sh/bash/ksh)
#cb4-2[ x ] || [ y ]
#cb4-3
#cb4-4# Valid extended test expressions (bash/ksh)
#cb4-5[[ x ]] || [[ y ]]
```

### Exceptions:

None
