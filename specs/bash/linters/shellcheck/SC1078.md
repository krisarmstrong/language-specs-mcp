# Did you forget to close this double-quoted string?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1greeting="hello
#cb1-2target="world"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1greeting="hello"
#cb2-2target="world"
```

### Rationale:

The first line is missing a quote.

ShellCheck warns when it detects multi-line double quoted, single quoted or backticked strings when the character that follows it looks out of place (and gives a companion warning [SC1079](SC1079) at that spot).

### Exceptions

If you do want a multiline variable, just make sure the character after it is a quote, space or line feed.

```
#cb3-1var='multiline
#cb3-2'value
```

can be rewritten for readability and to remove the warning:

```
#cb4-1var='multiline
#cb4-2value'
```

As always ``..`` should be rewritten to `$(..)`.
