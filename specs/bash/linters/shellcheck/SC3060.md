## In POSIX sh, string replacement is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "${var//foo/bar}"
```

### Correct code:

Either switch the shebang to `bash` or `ksh`, or rewrite the expansion using a tool like `sed`:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "$var" | sed 's/foo/bar/g'
```

### Rationale:

String replacement in parameter expansion is a `bash` and `ksh` extension. `dash` and POSIX `sh` does not support it.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
