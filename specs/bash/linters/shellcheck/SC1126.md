## Place shellcheck directives before commands, not after.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var=1 # shellcheck disable=SC2034
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# shellcheck disable=SC2034
#cb2-2var=1 
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck expects directives to come before the relevant command. They are not allowed after.

### Exceptions:

If this is not a directive and just a comment mentioning ShellCheck, please rewrite or capitalize:

```
var=1 # ShellCheck encourages lowercase variable names
```
