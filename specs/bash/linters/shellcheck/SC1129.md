## You need a space before the `!`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while! [ -f file ]
#cb1-2do sleep 1; done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while ! [ -f file ]
#cb2-2do sleep 1; done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword immediately followed by a `!`. There needs to be a space between them.

### Exceptions:

None
