## In POSIX sh, `+=` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var="Hello "
#cb1-2var+="World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var="Hello "
#cb2-2var="${var}World"
```

### Rationale:

Using `+=` to concatenate to an existing variable is a ksh/bash extension. For POSIX sh or dash, write out the full expression. Be careful to use braces if the text you append could be confused for a variable (as in the example, to avoid `$varWorld` being interpreted as `${varWorld}`)

### Exceptions:

None.
