## This is a glob used as a command name. Was it supposed to be in `${..}`, array, or is it missing quoting?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for f in $(*.png); do echo "$f"; done   # Trying to loop over a glob
#cb1-2array=$(*.txt)                          # Trying to assign an array
#cb1-3echo "$(array[1])"                      # Trying to expand an array
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for f in *.png; do echo "$f"; done
#cb2-2array=(*.txt)
#cb2-3echo "${array[1]}"
```

### Rationale:

You are using a glob as a command name. This is usually a mistake caused by one of the following:

- Trying to use ``*foo*`` or `$(*foo*)` to expand a glob.
- Using `var=$(*.txt)` instead of `var=(*.txt)` to assign an array.
- Using `$(..)` instead of `${..}` when expanding an array element.
- Running a program with a name or directory that contains glob characters without escaping them.

Look up and double check the syntax of what you're trying to do.

### Exceptions:

None. If you want to specify a command name via glob, e.g. to not hard code version in `./myprogram-*/foo`, expand to array or parameters first to allow handling the cases of 0 or 2+ matches.
