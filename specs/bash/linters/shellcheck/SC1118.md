## Delete whitespace after the here-doc end token.

### Problematic code:

"▭" below indicates an otherwise invisible space:

```
#cb1-1cat << "eof"
#cb1-2Hello
#cb1-3eof▭   
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1cat << "eof"
#cb2-2Hello
#cb2-3eof
```

### Rationale:

The end token of your here document has trailing whitespace. This is invisible to the naked eye, but shells do not accept it.

Remove the trailing whitespace.

### Exceptions:

None.
