## Consider using `grep -c` instead of `grep | wc`

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1grep foo | wc -l
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1grep -c foo
```

#### For multiple files

Instead of:

```
#cb3-1grep foo *.log | wc -l
```

You can pipe all the file contents into `grep` (passing the files directly to `grep` causes `-c` to print each file's count separately, rather than the total):

```
#cb4-1cat *.log | grep foo -c
```

### Rationale:

This is purely a stylistic issue. `grep` can count lines without piping to `wc`.

Often this number is only used to see whether there are matches (i.e. `== 0`). In these cases it's clearer and more efficient to use `grep -q` and check its exit status:

```
#cb5-1if grep -q pattern file; then
#cb5-2  echo "The file contains the pattern"
#cb5-3fi
```

Also note that in `foo | grep bar | wc -l`, `wc` will mask the exit code of `grep` by default (i.e. without `set -o pipefail`), and always return success. If replacing with `foo | grep -c bar`, `grep` will exit non-zero when there are no matches. This is generally desirable (see above), but may require handling when used with `set -e`.

### Exceptions

If you find piping to `wc` is clearer in a given situation it's fine to [ignore](ignore) this error.
