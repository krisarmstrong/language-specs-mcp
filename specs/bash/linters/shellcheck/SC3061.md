## In POSIX sh, `read` without a variable is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while read -r;
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3    echo "line: ${REPLY}"
#cb1-4done < foolist
```

### Correct code:

Add a variable to read and use it later on:

```
#cb2-1while read -r foo;
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3    echo "line: ${foo}"
#cb2-4done < foolist
```

### Rationale:

This behavior is not allowed [in
POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/read.html).

### Exceptions:

None. This warning is not emitted in `ksh` or `bash` where read can be used without an argument.
