# For command expansion, the tick should slant left (``` vs `´`).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo "Your username is ´whoami´"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "Your username is $(whoami)" # Preferred
#cb2-2echo "Your username is `whoami`"  # Deprecated, will give [SC2006]
```

### Rationale:

In some fonts it's hard to tell ticks apart, but Bash strongly distinguishes between backticks (grave accent ```), forward ticks (acute accent `´`) and regular ticks (apostrophe `'`).

Backticks start command expansions, while forward ticks are literal. To help spot bugs, ShellCheck parses backticks and forward ticks interchangeably.

### Exceptions

If you want to write out literal forward ticks, such as fancyful ascii quotation marks:

```
#cb3-1echo "``Proprietary software is an injustice.´´  - Richard Stallman"
```

use single quotes instead:

```
#cb4-1echo '``Proprietary software is an injustice.´´  - Richard Stallman'
```

To nest forward ticks in command expansion, use `$(..)` instead of ``..``.
