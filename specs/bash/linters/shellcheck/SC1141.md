## Unexpected tokens after compound command. Bad redirection or missing `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while echo "$2"; do true; done \
#cb1-2  head -n "$1"
#cb1-3
#cb1-4while sleep 1; do date; done > my file
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while echo "$2"; do true; done \
#cb2-2  | head -n "$1"
#cb2-3
#cb2-4while sleep 1; do date; done > "my file"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found unexpected trailing characters after a compound command.

The only things allowed after compound commands are redirections, shell keywords, and the various command separators (`;`, `&`, `|`, `&&`, `||`).

In the first example, a `|` was missing, causing `head` to appear as an unexpected trailing word, instead of being piped to. In the second example, a lack of quoting caused `file` to appear as an unexpected trailing word, instead of being part of the redirection.

Examine your statement and correct the problem.
