## This shebang was unrecognized. ShellCheck only supports sh/bash/dash/ksh. Add a 'shell' directive to specify.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/mywrapper
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/mywrapper
#cb2-2# shellcheck shell=bash
#cb2-3echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

You have specified a shebang that ShellCheck doesn't recognize. This can be due to invoking the script via a wrapper, specifying a dummy like `#!/bin/false` to prevent execution, or trying to check a script for a non-Bourne shell or tool.

If this really is a sh/bash/dash/ksh script, please add a `shell` directive after the shebang to tell ShellCheck how to interpret the script, as in the example. You can also specify the shell with the `-s` flag.

If this is a script in some other language, like `#!/bin/sed` for a `sed` script, then sorry -- ShellCheck does not support `sed`, `awk`, `expect` scripts. It only supports Bourne style shell scripts.

### Exceptions:

None.
