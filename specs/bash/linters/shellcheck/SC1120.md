## No comments allowed after here-doc token. Comment the next line instead.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1cat << eof  # --- Start greeting --
#cb1-2Hello
#cb1-3eof         # --- End greeting ---
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1cat << eof  # --- Start greeting --
#cb2-2Hello
#cb2-3eof
#cb2-4            # --- End greeting ---
```

### Rationale:

The terminator token for a here document must be on an entirely separate line. No comments are allowed on this line.

Place the comment somewhere else, such as on the following line.

### Exceptions:

None
