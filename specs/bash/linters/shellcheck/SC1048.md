## Can't have empty then clauses (use `true` as a no-op).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ -e foo ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  # TODO: handle this
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ -e foo ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  # TODO: handle this
#cb2-4  true
#cb2-5fi
#cb2-6
#cb2-7# Or use the no-op colon operator ":"
#cb2-8if [ -e foo ]
#cb2-9then
#cb2-10  # TODO: handle this
#cb2-11  :
#cb2-12fi
```

### Rationale:

Shells do not allow empty `then` clauses. They need at least one command (and comments are not commands).

If you want a `then` clause that does nothing, use a dummy command like `true`.

### Exceptions:

None.
