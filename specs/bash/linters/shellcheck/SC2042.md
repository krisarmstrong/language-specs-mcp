## Use spaces, not commas, to separate loop elements.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for f in foo,bar,baz
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  echo "$f"
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for f in foo bar baz
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  echo "$f"
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `for` loop where the items appeared to be delimited by commas. These will be treated as literal commas. Use spaces instead.

### Exceptions:

None
