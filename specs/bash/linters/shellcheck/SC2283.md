## Use `[ ]` to compare values, or remove spaces around `=` to assign (or quote `'='` if literal).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1# Assignment
#cb1-2var = value
#cb1-3
#cb1-4# Comparison
#cb1-5if $var = value
#cb1-6then
#cb1-7  echo "Match"
#cb1-8fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# Assignment
#cb2-2var=value
#cb2-3
#cb2-4# Comparison
#cb2-5if [ "$var" = value ]
#cb2-6then
#cb2-7  echo "Match"
#cb2-8fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an unquoted `=` after a word.

If this was supposed to be a comparison, use square brackets: `[ "$var" = value ]`

If this was supposed to be an assignment, remove spaces around `=`: `var=value`

### Exceptions:

If the `=` was meant literally, quote it:

```
grep '=true' file.cfg
```
