## Can only return 0-255. Other data should be written to stdout.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1myfunc() {
#cb1-2  return "Hello $USER"
#cb1-3}
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1myfunc() {
#cb2-2  echo "Hello $USER"
#cb2-3  return 0
#cb2-4}
```

### Rationale:

In many languages, `return` is used to return from the function with a final result.

In sh/bash, `return` can only be used to signal success or failure (0 = success, 1-255 = failure), more akin to `throw/raise` in other languages.

Results should instead be written to stdout and captured:

```
#cb3-1message=$(myfunc)
#cb3-2echo "The function wrote: $message"
```

In functions that return small integers, such as getting the cpu temperature, the value should still be written to stdout. `return` should be reserved for error conditions, such as "can't determine CPU temperature". Error or failure messages should be written to stderr.

Note in particular that `return -1` is equivalent to `return 255`, but that `return 1` is the more canonical way of expressing the first possible error code.

### Exceptions:

None
