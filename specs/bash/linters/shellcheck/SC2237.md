## Use `[ -n .. ]` instead of `! [ -z .. ]`.

(or "Use `[ -z .. ]` instead of `! [ -n .. ]`.)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if ! [ -n "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then echo "JAVA_HOME not specified"; fi
#cb1-2if ! [ -z "$STY" ];       then echo "You are already running screen"; fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]; then echo "JAVA_HOME not specified"; fi
#cb2-2if [ -n "$STY" ];       then echo "You are already running screen"; fi
```

### Rationale:

You have negated `test -z` or `test -n`, resulting in a needless double-negative. You can just use the other operator instead:

```
#cb3-1# Identical tests to verify that a value is assigned
#cb3-2! [ -z foo ] # Not has no value
#cb3-3[ -n foo ]   # Has value
#cb3-4
#cb3-5# Identical tests to verify that a value is empty
#cb3-6! [ -n foo ] # Not is non-empty
#cb3-7[ -z foo ]   # Is empty
```

### Exceptions:

This is a stylistic issue that does not affect correctness. If you prefer the original expression, you can [Ignore](Ignore) it with a directive or flag.
