## Redirecting to `echo`, a command that doesn't read stdin. Bad quoting or missing `xargs`?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo << eof
#cb1-2  Hello World
#cb1-3eof
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1cat << eof
#cb2-2  Hello World
#cb2-3eof
```

### Rationale:

You are redirecting to one of several commands that don't read from stdin.

This may happen when:

- Confusing one command for another, e.g. using `echo` where `cat` was intended.
- Incorrectly quoting angle brackets, e.g. using `echo <p>Hello` which tries to read from a file `p`.
- Missing `xargs`, e.g. `mv -t dir < files` instead of `xargs mv -t dir < files` (or more safely, `tr '\n' '\0' < files | xargs -0 mv -t dir`), because stdin should be passed as parameters.

Check your logic, and rewrite the command so data is passed correctly.

### Exceptions:

If you've overridden a command to return output, you can either rename it to make this obvious, or [ignore](ignore) this message.
