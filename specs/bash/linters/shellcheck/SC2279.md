## `$0` can't be assigned in Dash. This becomes a command name.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/dash
#cb1-2$0=myname
```

### Correct code:

`$0` can not be changed in Dash.

### Rationale:

You appear to be trying to assign a new value to `$0` in Dash.

Dash does not support this. Write around it, or switch to Bash.

### Exceptions:

If you instead wanted to compare the value of `$0`, use a comparison like `[ "$0" = "myname" ]`.
