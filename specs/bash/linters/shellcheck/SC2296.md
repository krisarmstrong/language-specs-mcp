## Parameter expansions can't start with `{`. Double check syntax.

(or any other character)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo "Hello ${{name}"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "Hello ${name}"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion `${something}` that starts with an invalid character. In the example, this was caused by accidentally duplicating the `{` in `${{name}`.

Double check the syntax of what you're trying to do.

### Exceptions:

Some Zsh specific parameter expansions like `${(q)value}` trigger this warning, but ShellCheck does not support Zsh.

If this warning triggers in code that works on Bash, Ksh, Dash or Sh, please [submit a
bug](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/new).
