## `#!/bin/sh` was specified, so ____ is not supported, even when sh is actually bash.

Note: Removed in [v0.4.2
- 2016-01-10](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/commit/f77821625c8e9203712f276d470341459ee60455)

The shebang indicates that the script works with `/bin/sh`, but you are using non-standard features that may not work with `/bin/sh`, even if /bin/sh is actually bash. Bash behaves differently when invoked as `sh`, and disabling support for the highlighted feature is one part of that.

Specify `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to ensure that bash (or your shell of choice) will be used, or rewrite the script to be more portable.

The Ubuntu wiki has [a
list of portability issues](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh) and suggestions on how to rewrite them.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
