## In POSIX sh, redirecting from/to globs is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2date > /tmp/log*.txt
```

### Correct code:

To redirect from/to the only match of a glob, expand the glob first:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2set -- /tmp/log*.txt
#cb2-3# PS: This is a good place to verify that there was exactly one match
#cb2-4date > "$1"
```

Alternatively, use a loop to redirect from/to all if that was the intention.

### Rationale:

Shells differ in whether (and how) they do pathname expansion on names in redirections. Avoid the issue by expanding the glob yourself.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
