## ShellCheck directives are only valid in front of complete commands like `case` statements, not individual case branches.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1case $? in
#cb1-2  0) echo "Success" ;;
#cb1-3  # shellcheck disable=2154
#cb1-4  *) echo "$cmd $flag returned failure" ;;
#cb1-5esac
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# Applies to everything in the `case` statement
#cb2-2# shellcheck disable=2154
#cb2-3case $? in
#cb2-4  0) echo "Success" ;;
#cb2-5  *) echo "$cmd $flag returned failure" ;;
#cb2-6esac
```

or

```
#cb3-1case $? in
#cb3-2  0) echo "Success" ;;
#cb3-3  *)
#cb3-4     # Applies to a single command within the `case`
#cb3-5     # shellcheck disable=2154
#cb3-6     echo "$cmd $flag returned failure"
#cb3-7     ;;
#cb3-8esac
```

### Rationale:

You appear to have put a directive before a branch in a case statement.

ShellCheck directives can not be scoped to individual branches of `case` statements, only to the entire `case`, or to individual commands within it. Please move the directive as appropriate.

(It is possible to apply directives to all commands within a `{ ..: }` command group, if you truly wish to apply a directive to multiple commands but not the full `case` statement.)

### Exceptions:

None.
