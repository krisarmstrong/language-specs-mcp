## You need a line feed or semicolon before the `do`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for file in * do
#cb1-2  echo "$file"
#cb1-3done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for file in *; do
#cb2-2  echo "$file"
#cb2-3done
#cb2-4
#cb2-5# or
#cb2-6
#cb2-7for file in *
#cb2-8do
#cb2-9  echo "$file"
#cb2-10done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `do` on the same line as a loop, but `do` only starts a loop block at the start of a line/statement. Make the `do` the start of a new line/statement by inserting a linefeed or semicolon in front of it.

### Exceptions:

If you wanted to treat `do` as a literal string, you can quote it to make this clear to ShellCheck and humans:

```
#cb3-1for f in "for" "do" "done"
#cb3-2do
#cb3-3  echo "Shell keywords include: $f"
#cb3-4done
```
