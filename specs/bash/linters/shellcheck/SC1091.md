## Not following: (error message here)

Reasons include: file not found, no permissions, not included on the command line, not allowing `shellcheck` to follow files with `-x`, etc.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1source somefile
```

### Correct code:

In case you have access to the file, e.g. if it is included in your source code repository:

```
#cb2-1# shellcheck source=somefile
#cb2-2source somefile
```

In case you do not have access to the file:

```
#cb3-1# shellcheck source=/dev/null
#cb3-2source somefile
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck, for whichever reason, is not able to access the source file.

This could be because:

- you did not include it on the command line,
- did not use `shellcheck -x` (or specified `external-sources=true` in the [.shellcheckrc](Directive#external-sources)) to allow following other files
- don't have permissions, or
- a variety of other problems.

Feel free to ignore the error with a [directive](directive).

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck is unable to follow dynamic paths, such as `source "$somedir/file"`. For these cases, see [SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive
to specify location](SC1090) instead. You may be seeing SC1091 because ShellCheck tried to be helpful and strip a leading dynamic path element as described on that page.

If you're fine with it, ignore the message with a [directive](directive).
