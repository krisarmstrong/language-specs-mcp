## Unexpected start of line. If breaking lines, `|`/`||`/`&&` should be at the end of the previous one.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1dmesg
#cb1-2  | grep "error"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1dmesg |
#cb2-2  grep "error"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a line that unexpectedly started with `|`, `||` or `&&`. This usually happens when a line is broken incorrectly.

When breaking around a `|`, `||` or `&&`, there are two options:

- Break the line after this token. `dmesg` is a complete command by itself, but `dmesg |` is not so the shell knows to continue on the next line.
- Use a `\` at the end of the previous line to explicitly tell the shell to continue on the next.

### Exceptions:

In v0.7.2 and below, this warning triggered incorrectly when starting a line with `&>`. In these versions, you can either [ignore](ignore) the warning, or move the redirection after the command name.
