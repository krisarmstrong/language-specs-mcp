## `-eq` is for integer comparisons. Use `=` instead.

Note: This warning seems replace by SC2170 or SC2309. Removed in [V0.4.2

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ $foo -eq "Y" ]]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[[ $foo = "Y" ]]
```

### Rationale:

Shells have two sets of comparison operators: for integers (`-eq`, `-gt`, ...) and strings (`=`, `>`, ...). ShellCheck has noticed that you're using an integer comparison with string data.

If you are in fact comparing integers, double check your parameters. Certain mistakes like `$$foo` or `${bar}}` can introduce non-numeric characters into otherwise numeric arguments.

### Exceptions

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
