## Trapping signals by number is not well-defined. Prefer signal names.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1trap myfunc 28
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1trap myfunc WINCH
```

### Rationale:

Signal numbers can vary between platforms. Prefer signal names, which are fixed.

Signal numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14 and 15 are specified as parts of the optional POSIX XSI and ShellCheck will not warn about these.

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
