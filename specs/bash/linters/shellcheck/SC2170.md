## Invalid number for `-eq`. Use `=` to compare as string (or use `$var` to expand as a variable).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1read -r n
#cb1-2if [ n -lt 0 ]
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4   echo "bad input"
#cb1-5fi
#cb1-6
#cb1-7if [ "$USER" -eq root ]
#cb1-8then
#cb1-9  echo "You are root"
#cb1-10fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1read -r n
#cb2-2if [ "$n" -lt 0 ]        # Numerical comparison
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4   echo "bad input"
#cb2-5fi
#cb2-6
#cb2-7if [ "$USER" = root ]    # String comparison
#cb2-8then
#cb2-9  echo "You are root"
#cb2-10fi
```

### Rationale:

You are comparing a string value with a numerical operator, such as `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt` or `-gt`. These only work for numbers.

If you want to compare the value as a string, switch to the equivalent string operator: `=`, `!=``\<` or `\>`.

If you want to compare it as a number, such as `n=42; while [ n -gt 1024/8 ]; ..`, then keep the operator and expand the operands yourself with `$var` or `$((expr))`: `while [ "$n" -gt $((1024/8)) ]`

### Exceptions:

None.
