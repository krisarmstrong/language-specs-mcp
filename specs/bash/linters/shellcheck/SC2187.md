## Ash scripts will be checked as Dash. Add `# shellcheck shell=dash` to silence.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/ash
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/ash
#cb2-2# shellcheck shell=dash
#cb2-3echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has no first class support for `ash`, but it does support its Debian fork `dash` and defaults to this whenever `ash` is specified.

Unfortunately, while the two are similar, they are not completely compatible. For example, `ash` supports `echo -e` but `dash` does not, so ShellCheck will incorrectly warn about it.

You can use a [directive](directive) to let ShellCheck know you're aware of this problem.

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
