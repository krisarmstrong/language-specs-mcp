## In POSIX sh, `-nt` is undefined.

Note: Removed in [v0.11.0
- 2025-08-23](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/aac0823e6b58f8a499e856e93738082691cbf212/CHANGELOG.md#removed)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2if [ Foo.java -nt Foo.class ]
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4  javac Foo.java
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

The easiest fix is to switch to a shell that does support `-nt`, like bash:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2if [ Foo.java -nt Foo.class ]
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4  javac Foo.java
#cb2-5fi
```

Otherwise, `find` can be used:

```
#cb3-1#!/bin/sh
#cb3-2if [ -n "$(find Foo.java -newer Foo.class)" ]
#cb3-3then
#cb3-4  javac Foo.java
#cb3-5fi
```

### Rationale:

`test -nt` is an extension in ksh, bash and dash, but it is [not
specified by POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html).

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
