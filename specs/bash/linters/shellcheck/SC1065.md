## Trying to declare parameters? Don't. Use `()` and refer to params as `$1`, `$2`, …

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1foo(input) {
#cb1-2  echo "$input"
#cb1-3}
#cb1-4foo("hello world");
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1foo() {
#cb2-2  echo "$1"
#cb2-3}
#cb2-4foo "hello world"
```

### Rationale:

Shell script functions behave just like scripts and other commands:

- They always take a 0 to N parameters, referred to with `$1`, `$2` etc. They can not declare parameters by name.
- They are executed using `name arg1 arg2`, and not with parentheses as C-like languages.

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
