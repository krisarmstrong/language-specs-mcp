## Numbers with leading 0 are considered octal.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo $(( 16 - 08 ))
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo $(( 16 - 8 ))
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an integer literal with a leading zero, but containing the digits 8 or 9.

This is invalid, as the integer will be interpreted as an octal value (e.g. 0777 == 0x1FF == 511).

To have the value parsed in base 10, either remove the leading zeros as in the example, or specify the radix explicitly:

```
echo $((10#08)) 
```

### Exceptions:

None
