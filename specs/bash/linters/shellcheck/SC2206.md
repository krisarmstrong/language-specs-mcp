## Quote to prevent word splitting/globbing, or split robustly with mapfile or `read -a`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1array=( $var )
```

### Correct code:

If the variable should be a single element:

```
#cb2-1array=( "$var" )
```

If it's multiple lines, each of which should be an element:

```
#cb3-1# For bash
#cb3-2mapfile -t array <<< "$var"
#cb3-3
#cb3-4# For ksh
#cb3-5printf '%s\n' "$var" | while IFS="" read -r line; do array+=("$line"); done
```

If it's a line with multiple words (separated by spaces, other delimiters can be chosen with IFS), [each of which should be an
element](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30212526):

```
#cb4-1# For bash
#cb4-2IFS=" " read -r -a array <<< "$var"
#cb4-3
#cb4-4# For ksh
#cb4-5IFS=" " read -r -A array <<< "$var"
```

### Rationale:

You are expanding a variable unquoted in an array. This will invoke the shell's sloppy word splitting and glob expansion.

Instead, prefer explicitly splitting (or not splitting):

- If the variable should become a single array element, quote it.
- If you want to split into lines or words, use `mapfile`, `read -ra` and/or `while` loops as appropriate.

This prevents the shell from doing unwanted splitting and glob expansion, and therefore avoiding problems with data containing spaces or special characters.

### Exceptions:

If you have already taken care (through setting IFS and `set -f`) to have word splitting work the way you intend, you can [ignore](ignore) this warning.
