## Use `&&` for logical AND. Single `&` will background and return true.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$1" = "install" ] & [ "$USER" != "root" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Must be root to install"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$1" = "install" ] && [ "$USER" != "root" ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Must be root to install"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `test` command followed by a `&`. This runs the test in the background, effectively ignoring it. To specify "logical AND" between two commands, use `&&`.

### Exceptions:

None
