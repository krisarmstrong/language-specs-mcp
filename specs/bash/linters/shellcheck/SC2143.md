## Use `grep -q` instead of comparing output with `[ -n .. ]`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ -n "$(find . | grep 'IMG[0-9]')" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Images found"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if find . | grep -q 'IMG[0-9]'
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Images found"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

The problematic code has to iterate the entire directory and read all matching lines into memory before making a decision.

The correct code is cleaner and stops at the first matching line, avoiding both iterating the rest of the directory and reading data into memory.

### Exceptions

The `pipefail` bash option may interfere with this rewrite, since the `if` will now in effect be evaluating the statuses of all commands instead of just the last one. Be careful using them together.
