## Shells disambiguate `((` differently or not at all. If the first `(` should start a subshell, add a space after it.

See [SC1102](SC1102), the similar warning for ambiguous `$((`.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
