## This case is not specified by getopts.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while getopts "vr" n
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  case "$n" in
#cb1-4    v) echo "Verbose" ;;
#cb1-5    r) echo "Recursive" ;;
#cb1-6    n) echo "Dry-run" ;;
#cb1-7    *) usage;;
#cb1-8  esac
#cb1-9done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while getopts "vrn" n    # 'n' added here
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  case "$n" in
#cb2-4    v) echo "Verbose" ;;
#cb2-5    r) echo "Recursive" ;;
#cb2-6    n) echo "Dry-run" ;;
#cb2-7    *) usage;;
#cb2-8  esac
#cb2-9done
```

### Rationale:

You have a `case` statement in a `while getopts` loop that matches a flag that hasn't been provided in the `getopts` option string.

Either add the flag to the options list, or delete the case statement.

### Exceptions:

None.
