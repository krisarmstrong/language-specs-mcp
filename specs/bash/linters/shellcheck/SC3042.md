## In POSIX sh, set flag `--default` is undefined

(or any other option)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/ksh
#cb1-2set --default
```

### Correct code:

Switch to a shell that supports these options, such as Ksh:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/ksh
#cb2-2set --default
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Ksh.

Most shell specific `set` flags are hard to emulate in POSIX, so use your best judgement as to whether you can make do without them, or if you should require a shell that supports them.

### Exceptions:

None
