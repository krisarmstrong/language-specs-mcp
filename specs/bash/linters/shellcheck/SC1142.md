## Use `done < <(cmd)` to redirect from process substitution (currently missing one `<`).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1sum=0
#cb1-2while IFS="" read -r n
#cb1-3do
#cb1-4  (( sum += n ))
#cb1-5done <(file) 
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1sum=0
#cb2-2while IFS="" read -r n
#cb2-3do
#cb2-4  (( sum += n ))
#cb2-5done < <(file) 
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `done` keyword followed by a process substitution, e.g. `done <(cmd)`.

The intention was most likely to redirect from this process substitution, in which case you will need one extra `<`: `done < <(cmd)`.

This is because `<(cmd)` expands to a filename (e.g. `/dev/fd/63`), and you need a `<` to redirect from filenames.

### Exceptions:

None
