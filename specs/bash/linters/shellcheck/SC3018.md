## In POSIX sh, `++` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2i=1
#cb1-3echo "$((i++))"
```

### Correct code:

Write out the increment/decrement operation explicitly:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2i=1
#cb2-3echo "$i"
#cb2-4i=$((i+1))
```

### Rationale:

Prefix and postfix increment and decrement are extensions in bash and ksh. They're not supported in dash or POSIX sh, which is what your shebang says you're using.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
