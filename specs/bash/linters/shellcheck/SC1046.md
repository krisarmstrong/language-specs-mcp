## Couldn't find `fi` for this `if`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if true
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "True"
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if true
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "True"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found an `if` statement that does not appear to have a matching terminating `fi`.

This could be because it's missing entirely, or because the `if` statement was incorrectly terminated by a mismatched `done`, `esac`, `)` or similar. A companion warning [SC1047](SC1047) is emitted at the point where ShellCheck expected the `fi`.

Check that the `if` statement is completely and correctly terminated.

### Exceptions:

None
