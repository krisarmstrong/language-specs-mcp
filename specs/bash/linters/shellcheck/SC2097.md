### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1name=World cmd -m "Hello $name"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1name=World
#cb2-2cmd -m "Hello $name"
```

If the original goal was to limit the scope of the variable, this can also be done in a subshell:

```
#cb3-1(
#cb3-2   name=World
#cb3-3   cmd -m "Hello $name"
#cb3-4) # 'name' does not leave this subshell
```

### Rationale:

In `name=World cmd "$name"`, `name=World` is passed in as part of the environment to `cmd` (i.e., in the `envp` parameter to [execve(2)](http://linux.die.net/man/2/execve)). This means that `cmd` and its children will see the parameter, but no other processes will.

However, `"$name"` is not expanded by `cmd`. `"$name"` is expanded by the shell before `cmd` is ever executed, and thus it will not use the new value.

The solution is to set the variable first, then use it as a parameter. If limited scope is desired, a `( subshell )` can be used.

### Exceptions

In the strange and fabricated scenarios where the script and a program uses a variable name for two different purposes, you can ignore this message. This is hard to conceive, since scripts should use lowercase variable names specifically to avoid collisions with the environment.
