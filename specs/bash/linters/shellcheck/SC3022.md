## In POSIX sh, named file descriptors is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1exec {n}> "$output"
#cb1-2echo "Your fd is $n"
```

### Correct code:

There is no simple, mechanical alternative for POSIX sh, but you can either switch to a shell that does support this (like `bash`), or hard code (or `eval`) a specific file descriptor.

### Rationale:

The syntax for opening an arbitrary file descriptor and assigning it to a variable for later use is a `bash` and `ksh` extension. It does not work on POSIX sh or `dash`.

### Exceptions:

None
