## Flip leading `$` and `"` if this should be a quoted substitution.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var=$"(whoami)"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var="$(whoami)"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a `$"(` or `$"{` . This is most likely due to flipping the dollar-sign and double quote:

```
echo $"(cmd)"  # Supposed to be "$(cmd)"
echo $"{var}"  # Supposed to be "${var}"
```

Instead of quoted substitutions, these will be interpreted as localized string resources (`$".."`) containing literal parentheses or curly braces. If this was not intentional, you should flip the `"` and `$` like in the example.

### Exceptions:

If you intentionally wanted a localized string literal `$".."` that starts with `(` or `{`, either [ignore](ignore) this error or start it with a different character.
