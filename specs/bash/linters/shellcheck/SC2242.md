## Can only exit with status 0-255. Other data should be written to stdout/stderr.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1exit "Bad filename"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "Bad filename" >&2
#cb2-2exit 1
```

### Rationale:

`exit` can only be used to signal success or failure (0 = success, 1-255 = failure). It can not be used to return string data, and it can not be used to print error messages.

String data should be written stdout, before an `exit 0` to exit with success.

Errors should instead be written to stderr, with an `exit 1` (or higher) to exit with failure:

```
#cb3-1if [ ! -f "$1" ]
#cb3-2then
#cb3-3   echo "$1 is not a regular file" >&2
#cb3-4   exit 1
#cb3-5fi
```

Note in particular that `exit -1` is equivalent to `exit 255`, but that `exit 1` is the more canonical way of expressing the first possible error code.

### Exceptions:

None
