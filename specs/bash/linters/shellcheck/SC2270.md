## To assign positional parameters, use `set -- first second ..` (or use `[ ]` to compare).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ -z "$1" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  $1="help"
#cb1-4fi
```

or

```
#cb2-1if $1="help"
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Usage: $0 filename"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1if [ -z "$1" ]
#cb3-2then
#cb3-3  set -- "help"
#cb3-4fi
```

or

```
#cb4-1if [ $1 = "help" ]
#cb4-2then
#cb4-3  echo "Usage: $0 filename"
#cb4-4fi
```

### Rationale:

You have a command on the form `$2=value`.

If the goal is to assign a new value to the positional parameters, use the `set` builtin: `set -- one two ..` will cause `$1` to be "one" and `$2` to be "two".

If you instead want to compare the value, use `[ ]` and add spaces: `[ "$1" = "foo" ]`

### Exceptions:

None
