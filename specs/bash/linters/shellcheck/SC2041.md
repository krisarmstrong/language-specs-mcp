## This is a literal string. To run as a command, use `$(..)` instead of `'..'` .

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for i in 'seq 1 10'
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  echo "$i"
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for i in $(seq 1 10)
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  echo "$i"
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

The intent was to run the code in the single quotes. This would have worked with slanted backticks, ``..``, but here the very similar looking single quotes `'..'` were used, resulting in a string literal instead of command output.

This is one of the many problems with backticks, so it's better to use `$(..)` to expand commands.

### Exceptions:

None.
