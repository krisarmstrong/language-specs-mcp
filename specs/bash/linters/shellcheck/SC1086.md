## Don't use `$` on the iterator name in for loops.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for $var in *
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  echo "$var"
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for var in *
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  echo "$var"
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

The variable is named `var`, and can be expanded to its value with `$var`.

The `for` loop expects the variable's name, not its value (and the name can not be specified indirectly).

### Exceptions

None.
