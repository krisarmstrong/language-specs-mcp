## `(..)` is a subshell. Did you mean `[ .. ]`, a test expression?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if ( -d mydir )
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "It's a directory"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ -d mydir ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "It's a directory"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

Tests like `-d` to see if something is a directory or `-z` to see if it's non-empty are actually flags to the `test` command, and only work as tests in that context. `[` is an alias for `test`, so you'll frequently see them written as `[ -d mydir ]`.

`( .. )` is completely unrelated, and is a subshell mostly used to scope shell modifications. They should not be used in `if` or `while` statements in shell scripts.

If you wanted to test a condition, rewrite the `( .. )` to `[ .. ]`.

### Exceptions:

None.

This error is triggered by having a unary test operator as the first command name in a subshell, which won't normally happen. Note that there's a similar warning [SC2205](SC2205) with a higher false positive rate.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
