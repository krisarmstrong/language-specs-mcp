## This expression is constant. Did you forget the `$` on a variable?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ myvar = "test" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Test mode"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$myvar" = "test" ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Test mode"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]` comparison that only involves literal strings. The intention was probably to check a variable or command output instead.

This is usually due to missing `$` or bad quoting:

```
if [[ "myvar" = "test" ]]             # always false because myvar is a literal string
if [[ "$myvar" = "test" ]]            # correctly compares a variable

if [ 'grep -c foo bar' -ge 10 ]       # always false because grep doesn't run
if [ "$(grep -c foo bar)" -ge 10 ]    # correctly checks grep output
```

### Exceptions:

None

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
