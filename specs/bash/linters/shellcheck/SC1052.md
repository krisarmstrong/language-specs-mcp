## Semicolons directly after `then` are not allowed. Just remove it.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if true; then; echo "Hi"; fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if true; then echo "Hi"; fi
```

### Rationale:

`then` keywords should not be followed by semicolons. It's not valid shell syntax.

You can follow them directly with a line break or another command.

### Exceptions:

None
