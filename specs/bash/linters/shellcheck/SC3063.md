## In POSIX sh, test -R and namerefs in general are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ -R foo ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  ..
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

POSIX sh has no concept of namerefs. Rewrite your logic to not depend on them, or switch to Bash or Ksh.

### Rationale:

`[ -R name ]` is used to check whether `name` is a `nameref`. Since POSIX sh has no namerefs, either use a shell that does, or rewrite to not need namerefs.

### Exceptions:

None
