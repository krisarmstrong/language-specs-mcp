## In POSIX sh, arithmetic base conversion is undefined

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "Hex $1 is decimal $((16#$1))"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "Hex $1 is decimal $(echo "ibase=16; $1" | bc)"
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

In this case, using radix specifiers in arithmetic contexts, such as `$((16#DEADBEEF))` is not portable. `bc` ibase/obase can be used instead.

### Exceptions:

None
