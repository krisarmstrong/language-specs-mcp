## Semicolon is not allowed directly after `do`. You can just delete it.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while true; do; true; done
#cb1-2
#cb1-3while true;
#cb1-4do;
#cb1-5  true;
#cb1-6done;
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while true; do true; done
#cb2-2
#cb2-3while true;
#cb2-4do
#cb2-5  true;
#cb2-6done;
```

### Rationale:

Semicolon `;` is not allowed directly after a `do` keyword. Follow it directly with either a command or a linefeed as shown in the example.

### Exceptions:

None.
