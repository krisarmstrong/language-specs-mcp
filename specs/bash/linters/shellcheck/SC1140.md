## Unexpected parameters after condition. Missing `&&`/`||`, or bad expression?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[ "$1" ] input="$1"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[ "$1" ] && input="$1"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found characters (other than redirections) after the `]` or `]]` in a test expression. This is not valid.

This sometimes happens when there was an additional expression or command, but joining `||` or `&&` is missing. Alternatively, it could happen due to typos (like `[[ $1 ]]]` with an extra `]`), or generally from malformed test expressions.

### Exceptions:

None
