## In POSIX sh, unary `-a` in place of `-e` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2if [ -a file.txt ]
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4  echo "file.txt exists"
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2if [ -e file.txt ]
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4  echo "file.txt exists"
#cb2-5fi
```

### Rationale:

`-a` was used in some shells to check for the existence of a file, but the POSIX standard and better supported equivalent is `-e`.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
