## This word is constant. Did you forget the `$` on a variable?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1case foo in
#cb1-2  bar) echo "Match"
#cb1-3esac
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1case $foo in
#cb2-2  bar) echo "Match"
#cb2-3esac
```

### Rationale:

You are using a `case` statement to compare a literal word.

You most likely wanted to treat this word as a `$variable` or `$(command)` instead.

### Exceptions:

None
