## `function` keyword is non-standard. Use `foo()` instead of `function foo`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2function hello {
#cb1-3    echo "Hello World"
#cb1-4}
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2hello() {
#cb2-3    echo "Hello World"
#cb2-4}
```

### Rationale:

`function` is a non-standard keyword that can be used to declare functions in Bash and Ksh.

In POSIX `sh` and `dash`, a function is defined without a `function` keyword. Instead, the function name is followed by `()` as in the correct example.

### Exceptions:

None
