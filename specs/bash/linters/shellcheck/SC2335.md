## Use `[ "$var" -ne 1 ]` instead of `[ ! "$var" -eq 1 ]`

and other binary operators such as

- `=` and `!=` (string)
- `-le` and `-gt`, and so forth (arithmetic)

### Optional - `avoid-negated-conditions`

This is an [optional](optional) rule, which means that it has a special "long name" and is not enabled by default. See the [optional](optional) page for more details. In short, you have to enable it with the long name instead of the "SC" code like you would with a normal rule:

#### `.shellcheckrc`

```
enable=avoid-negated-conditions # SC2335
```

### Problematic code:

```
#cb2-1if [ ! "$var" -eq 1 ]; then :; fi
#cb2-2if ! [ "$var" = foo ]; then :; fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1if [ "$var" -ne 1 ]; then :; fi
#cb3-2if [ "$var" != foo ]; then :; fi
```

### Rationale:

Double negation of such binary operators is unnecessary.

### Exceptions:

This is a stylistic issue that does not affect correctness. If you prefer the original expression, you can [Ignore](Ignore) it with a directive or flag.

This rule is not applied to the followings:

- `<` and `>` (lexicographical)
- `-nt` and `-ot` (file timestamp)
- `=~` (regular expression)
