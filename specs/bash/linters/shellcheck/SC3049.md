## In POSIX sh, using lower/mixed case for signal names is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1trap 'handle_sigint' int
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1trap 'handle_sigint' INT
```

### Rationale:

POSIX requires that signal names [be
given in uppercase](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_28):

The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal specified using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, as listed in the tables of signal names in the <signal.h> header defined in XBD Headers; for example, HUP, INT, QUIT, TERM. Implementations may permit names with the SIG prefix or ignore case in signal names as an extension.

### Exceptions:

None
