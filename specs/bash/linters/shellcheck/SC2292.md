## Prefer `[[ ]]` over `[ ]` for tests in Bash/Ksh.

### Optional - `require-double-brackets`

This is an [optional](optional) rule, which means that it has a special "long name" and is not enabled by default. See the [optional](optional) page for more details. In short, you have to enable it with the long name instead of the "SC" code like you would with a normal rule:

#### `.shellcheckrc`

```
enable=require-double-brackets # SC2292
```

### Problematic code:

```
#cb2-1[ -e /etc/issue ] 
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1[[ -e /etc/issue ]]
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has been explicitly asked to warn about uses of `[ .. ]` in favor of the extended Bash/Ksh test `[[ .. ]]`.

`[[ .. ]]` suppresses word splitting and globbing, supports a wider variety of tests, and is generally safer and better defined than `[ .. ]`. For an in-depth list of differences, see the Related Resources.

### Exceptions:

This check is not enabled by default, and may have been turned on for your current project by someone who wants it enforced. You can still [ignore](ignore) it with a directive.

This suggestion does not trigger for Sh or Dash scripts, even when explicitly enabled, as these shells don't support `[[ .. ]]`.
