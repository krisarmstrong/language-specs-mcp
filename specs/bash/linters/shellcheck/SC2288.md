## This is interpreted as a command name ending with apostrophe. Double check syntax.

(also applies to multiple other characters like `.,([{<>}])#"'`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var=$("wget 'http://www.shellcheck.net/'")
#cb1-2echo Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}
#cb1-3array=val1, val2, val3
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var="$(wget 'http://www.shellcheck.net/')"
#cb2-2echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
#cb2-3array=(val1 val2 val3)
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name ending with a symbol, such as a comma, parenthesis, quote, or similar. This is almost always due to a syntax issue in the script.

In the examples, bad quoting and invalid array syntax caused the shell to try to run commands ending in apostrophe, curly brace, and comma, respectively.

### Exceptions:

If you have a command that does end in a symbol, you can ignore this message.
