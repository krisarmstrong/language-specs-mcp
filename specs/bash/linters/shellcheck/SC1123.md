## ShellCheck directives are only valid in front of complete compound commands, like `if`, not e.g. individual `elif` branches.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$prod" = "true" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Prod mode"
#cb1-4# shellcheck disable=2154
#cb1-5elif [ "$debug" = "true" ]
#cb1-6then
#cb1-7  echo "Debug mode"
#cb1-8fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# Applies to entire `if...fi` command
#cb2-2# shellcheck disable=2154
#cb2-3if [ "$prod" = "true" ]
#cb2-4then
#cb2-5  echo "Prod mode"
#cb2-6elif [ "$debug" = "true" ]
#cb2-7then
#cb2-8  echo "Debug mode"
#cb2-9fi
```

or

```
#cb3-1if [ "$prod" = "true" ]
#cb3-2then
#cb3-3  echo "Prod mode"
#cb3-4elif  # Applies only to this [ .. ] command
#cb3-5      # shellcheck disable=2154
#cb3-6      [ "$debug" = "true" ]
#cb3-7then
#cb3-8  echo "Debug mode"
#cb3-9fi
```

### Rationale:

You appear to have put a directive before a non-command keyword, such as `elif`, `else`, `do`, `;;` or similar.

Unlike many other linters, ShellCheck comment directives apply to the next shell command, rather than to the next line of text.

This means that you can put a directive in front of a `while` loop, `if` statement or function definition, and it will apply to that entire structure.

However, it also means that you can not apply the directive to non-commands like an individual `elif` or `else` block since these are not commands by themselves, and rather just parts of an `if` compound command.

Please move the directive in front of the nearest applicable command that contains the code you want to apply it to, such as before the `if`.

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
