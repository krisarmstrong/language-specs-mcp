## This function is only defined later. Move the definition up.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2myfunction
#cb1-3
#cb1-4myfunction() {
#cb1-5  echo "Hello World"
#cb1-6}
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2myfunction() {
#cb2-3  echo "Hello World"
#cb2-4}
#cb2-5myfunction
```

### Rationale:

You are calling a function that you are defining later in the file. The function definition must come first.

Function definitions are much like variable assignments, and define a name at the point the definition is "executed". This is why they must happen before their first use.

This is especially apparent when defining functions conditionally:

```
#cb3-1case "$(uname -s)" in
#cb3-2  Linux) hi() { echo "Hello from Linux"; } ;;
#cb3-3  Darwin) hi() { echo "Hello from macOS"; } ;;
#cb3-4  *) hi() { echo "Hello from something else"; } ;;
#cb3-5esac
#cb3-6
#cb3-7hi
```

### Exceptions:

None.
