## Add `;`/`&` terminators (and other syntax) on the line with the `<<`, not here.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1sudo bash -s << "END"
#cb1-2  cmd1
#cb1-3  cmd2
#cb1-4END &
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1sudo bash -s << "END" &
#cb2-2  cmd1
#cb2-3  cmd2
#cb2-4END
```

### Rationale:

You are using `&`, `;`, `&>` or similar after a here document. This is not allowed.

This should instead be part of the line that initiated the here document, i.e. the one with the `<<`.

If it helps, look at `<< "END"` as if it was `< file`, and make sure the resulting command is valid. This is what the shell does. You can then append here document data after the command.

### Exceptions:

None.
