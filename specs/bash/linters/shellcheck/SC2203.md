## Globs are ignored in `[[ ]]` except right of `=`/`!=`. Use a loop.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ current.log -nt backup/*.log ]] && echo "This is the latest file"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1newerThanAll=true
#cb2-2for log in backup/*.log
#cb2-3do
#cb2-4  [[ current.log -nt "$log" ]] || newerThanAll=false
#cb2-5done
#cb2-6[[ "$newerThanAll" = "true" ]] && echo "This is the latest file"
```

### Rationale:

Globs in `[[ ]]` will not filename expand, and will be treated literally (or as patterns on the right-hand side of `=`, `==` and `!=`).

The problematic code is equivalent to `[[ current.log -nt 'backup/*.png' ]`, and will look for a file with a literal asterisk in the name.

Instead, you can iterate over the filenames you want with a loop, and apply your condition to each filename.

### Exceptions:

None.
