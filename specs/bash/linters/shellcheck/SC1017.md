## Literal carriage return. Run script through `tr -d '\r'` .

### Problematic code:

```
$ cat -v myscript
#!/bin/sh^M
echo "Hello World"^M
```

### Correct code:

```
$ cat -v myscript
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

The script uses Windows/MS-DOS style `\r\n` line terminators instead of Unix-style `\n` terminators. The additional `\r` aka `^M` aka carriage return characters will be treated literally, and results in all sorts strange bugs and messages.

You can verify this with `cat -v yourfile` and see whether or not each line ends with a `^M`. To delete them, open the file in your editor and save the file as "Unix", "Unix/macOS Format", `:set ff=unix` or similar if it supports it.

If you don't know how to get your editor to save a file with Unix line terminators, you can use `tr`:

```
#cb3-1tr -d '\r' < badscript > goodscript
#cb3-2# or
#cb3-3dos2unix badscript
```

This will read a script `badscript` with possible carriage returns, and write `goodscript` without them.

### Exceptions:

None
