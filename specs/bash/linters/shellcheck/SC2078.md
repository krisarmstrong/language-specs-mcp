## This expression is constant. Did you forget a `$` somewhere?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "myvar" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "myvar is set"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$myvar" ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "myvar is set"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]` statement that just contains a literal string. Such a check does not do anything useful, and will always be true (or always false, for empty strings).

This is usually due to missing `$` or bad quoting:

```
if [[ STY ]             # always true
if [[ $STY ]]           # checks variable $STY

if [[ 'grep foo bar' ]] # always true
if [[ `grep foo bar` ]] # checks grep output (poorly)
if grep -q foo bar      # checks for grep match (preferred)
```

### Exceptions:

None

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
