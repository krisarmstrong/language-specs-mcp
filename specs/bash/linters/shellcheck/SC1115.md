## Remove spaces between `#` and `!` in the shebang.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1# !/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

The script has spaces between the `#` and `!` in the shebang. This is not valid.

Remove the spaces so the OS can correctly recognize the file as a script.

### Exceptions:

None.
