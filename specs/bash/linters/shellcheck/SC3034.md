## In POSIX sh, `$(<file)` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1content=$(<file)
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1content=$(cat file)
```

### Rationale:

In bash and ksh, `$(< file)` will expand to the full contents of the file.

However, in dash and POSIX sh, it will instead expand to nothing. This is because it's not recognized as special, and simply results in the command output of `< file`, a no-op command that opens the file and exits without reading it.

### Exceptions:

None.
