## In POSIX sh, `declare` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2declare var="value"
```

or

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2declare -r readonly
```

or

```
#cb3-1#!/bin/sh
#cb3-2declare ...
```

### Correct code:

If assigning a simple variable outside of a function, skip `declare` all together:

```
#cb4-1var="value"
```

If declaring a variable read-only:

```
#cb5-1var=value
#cb5-2readonly var
```

If you are unable to find a suitable replacement, consider switching to a shell that supports `declare`:

```
#cb6-1#!/bin/bash
#cb6-2declare ...
```

Indexed arrays, associative arrays, local variables, namerefs, and integer variables are not supported in POSIX sh. Either write around them, or switch to a shell that supports them.

### Rationale:

The `declare` command is non-standard, and most of its functionality is not available across shells.

Either find a POSIX replacement, or switch to a shell that is guaranteed to support them.

### Exceptions:

If your `declare` command is guarded by a check of the shell version, such as inspecting `$BASH_VERSION`, you can ignore this message.
