## In POSIX sh, `let` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2let x=2+2
```

### Correct code:

Use standard `$((arithmetic expansion))` instead of legacy `let`:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2x=$((2+2))
```

### Rationale:

`let` is a command used for arithmetic in some shells, but it's not a standard command. Use `$((..))` instead.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
