## `=~` is for regex, but this looks like a glob. Use `=` instead.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ $file =~ *.txt ]]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[[ $file = *.txt ]]
```

### Rationale:

You are using `=~` to match against a regex -- specifically a Extended Regular Expression (ERE) -- but the right-hand side looks more like a glob:

- It may have a leading `*`, like in `*.txt`

  - In a glob, this matches strings ending in `.txt`, like `readme.txt` but not `foo.sh`
  - In an ERE, this matches a literal asterisk, followed by any character, and then `txt`, such as `*itxt` but not `test.txt`

- It may be a single letter followed by a `*`, like in `s*`. 

  - In a glob, this matches strings starting with `s`, such as `shell` and `set`.
  - In an ERE, this matches zero or more `s`s, such as `dog` (because it does in fact contain zero or more `s`'s)

Please ensure that the pattern is correct as an ERE, or switch to glob matching if that's what you intended.

This is similar to [SC2063](SC2063), where `grep "*foo*"` produces an equivalent warning.

### Exceptions:

If you are aware of the difference, you can [ignore](ignore) this message, but this warning is not emitted for the more probable EREs `\*.txt`, `\.txt$`, `^s` or `s+`, so it should rarely be necessary.
