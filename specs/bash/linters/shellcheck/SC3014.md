## In POSIX sh, `==` in place of `=` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2if [ $1 == "-n" ]
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4  dry_run=1
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2if [ $1 = "-n" ]
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4  dry_run=1
#cb2-5fi
```

### Rationale:

`==` is used for equality comparison in C-like languages, and is also supported by `bash` and `ksh` in `[ .. ]` and `test` expressions.

`sh` and `dash` only supports `=` for equality comparison, so use that instead.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
