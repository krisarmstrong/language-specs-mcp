## Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location

### Problematic code

```
#cb1-1. "${util_path}"
```

### Correct code

```
#cb2-1# shellcheck source=src/util.sh
#cb2-2. "${util_path}"
```

### Rationale

ShellCheck is not able to include sourced files from paths that are determined at runtime. The file will not be read, potentially resulting in warnings about unassigned variables and similar.

Use a [Directive](Directive) to point shellcheck to a fixed location it can read instead.

ShellCheck v0.7.2+ will strip a single expansion followed by a slash, e.g. `${var}/util.sh` or `$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/util.sh`, and treat them as `./util.sh`. This allows the use of `source-path` directives or `-P` flags to specify the location.

### Exceptions

If you don't care that ShellCheck is unable to account for the file, specify `# shellcheck source=/dev/null`.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
