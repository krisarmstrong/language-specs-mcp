## This action ignores everything before the `-o`. Use `\( \)` to group.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1find . -name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mkv' -exec cp {} /media \;
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1find . \( -name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mkv' \) -exec cp {} /media \;
```

Note that the space between `\(` and `-name` in this command is significant.

### Rationale:

In `find`, two predicates with no operator between them is considered a logical, short-circuiting AND (as if using `-a`). E.g., `-name '*.mkv' -exec ..` is the same as `-name '*.mkv' -a -exec ..`.

`-a` has higher precedence than `-o`, so `-name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mkv' -a -exec ..` is equivalent to `-name '*.avi' -o \( -name '*.mkv' -a -exec .. \)`.

In other words, the problematic code means "if name matches `*.avi`, do nothing. Otherwise, if it matches `*.mkv`, execute a command.".

In the correct code, we use `\( \)` to group to get the evaluation order we want. The correct code means "if name matches `*.avi` or `*.mkv`, then execute a command", which was what was intended.

### Exceptions

If you're aware of this, you can either ignore this error or group to make it explicit. For example, to decompress all gz files except tar.gz, you can use:

```
#cb3-1find . -name '*.tar.gz' -o \( -name '*.gz' -exec gzip -d {} + \)
```
