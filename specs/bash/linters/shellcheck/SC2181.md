## Check exit code directly with e.g. `if mycmd;`, not indirectly with `$?`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1make mytarget
#cb1-2
#cb1-3if [ $? -ne 0 ]
#cb1-4then
#cb1-5  echo "Build failed"
#cb1-6fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if ! make mytarget
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Build failed"
#cb2-4fi
```

For the Solaris 10 Bourne shell:

```
#cb3-1if make mytarget
#cb3-2then
#cb3-3  :
#cb3-4else
#cb3-5  echo "Build failed"
#cb3-6fi
```

### Rationale:

Running a command and then checking its exit status `$?` against 0 is redundant.

Instead of just checking the exit code of a command, it checks the exit code of a command (e.g. `[`) that checks the exit code of a command.

Apart from the redundancy, there are other reasons to avoid this pattern:

- Since the command and its status test are decoupled, inserting an innocent command like `echo "make finished"` after `make` will cause the `if` statement to silently start comparing `echo`'s status instead.
- Scripts that run or are called with `set -e` aka `errexit` will exit immediately if the command fails, even though they're followed by a clause that handles failure.
- The value of `$?` is overwritten by `[`/`[[`, so you can't get the original value in the relevant then/else block (e.g. `if mycmd; then echo "Success"; else echo "Failed with $?"; fi`).

To check that a command returns success, use `if mycommand; then ...`.

To check that a command returns failure, use `if ! mycommand; then ...`. Notice that `!` will overwrite `$?` value.

To additionally capture output with command substitution: `if ! output=$(mycommand); then ...`

This also applies to `while`/`until` loops.

The default Solaris 10 Bourne shell does not support negating exit statuses with `!`, so `! mycommand` tries to invoke a utility named "!" instead. To test for failure, use `if mycommand; then :; else ...; fi` and `until mycommand; do ...; done`.

### Exceptions:

None.
