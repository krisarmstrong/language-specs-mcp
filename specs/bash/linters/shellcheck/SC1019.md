## Expected this to be an argument to the unary condition.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[ -x ]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[ -x "myfile" ]
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a unary test operator that does not appear to be followed by a valid shell word.

This could be because of a misplaced `]`, `)`, or a missing space before the `]`.

Check the syntax, make sure the test operator has an operand, and try again.

### Exceptions:

None.
