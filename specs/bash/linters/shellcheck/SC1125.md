## Invalid `key=value` pair in directive

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1# shellcheck disable=SC2153 (variable not a misspelling)
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# shellcheck disable=SC2153 # variable not a misspelling
```

### Rationale:

A comment at the end of a directive must be preceded by a `#` to avoid it being interpreted as an instruction. The [directive page](Directive#documenting-directive-use) contains more guidance about commenting style.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
