## In POSIX sh, lexicographical `\<` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2x="aardvark"
#cb1-3y="zebra"
#cb1-4if [ $x \< $y ]
#cb1-5then
#cb1-6  echo "$x comes before $y in the dictionary"
#cb1-7fi
```

### Correct code:

First, make sure you wanted a lexicographical comparison (aka dictionary order), and not a numerical comparison.

Then to compare as string, you can use `expr` and make sure that the strings are not interpreted numerically by adding some non-numerical data to them. Here, an apostrophe is prepended:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2x="aardvark"
#cb2-3y="zebra"
#cb2-4if expr "'$x" \< "'$y" > /dev/null
#cb2-5then
#cb2-6  echo "$x comes before $y in the dictionary"
#cb2-7fi
```

### Rationale:

The `test` binary operators `>`, `\>`, `<`, and `\<` are not part of POSIX and not guaranteed to be supported in scripts targeting `sh`.

The `expr` functionality is specified by POSIX.

### Exceptions:

If you know your `sh` will be e.g. `dash`, consider explicitly using `#!/bin/dash`.
