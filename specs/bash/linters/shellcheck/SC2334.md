## You probably wanted || here, otherwise it's always false.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if (( ret == 137 && ret == 143 ))
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Process killed by SIGTERM/SIGKILL"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if (( ret == 137 || ret == 143 ))
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Process killed by SIGTERM/SIGKILL"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

The problematic condition will never trigger because of a logic error.

In English one think say "I want to check for the numbers `137` and `143`", but the test ends up checking that the number is both `137` and `143` at the same time, which it can't be (if the number is 137, it necessarily won't be 143, and vice versa).

The correct check is "if the number is `137` or if the number is `143`", which will be true if the value is either 137 or 143.

### Exceptions:

None
