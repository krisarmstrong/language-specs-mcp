## This shebang specifies a directory. Ensure the interpreter is a file.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh/
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

The shebang specifies which file to use as an interpreter, but probably due to some kind of typo, your script's interpreter ends in a `/`, indicating a directory.

Ensure it points to a valid executable filename.

### Exceptions:

None
