## Warning: deletes a system directory.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1rm -rf /usr /lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1rm -rf /usr/lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg
```

### Rationale:

The example line of code was an actual bug in the [Bumblebee
NVIDIA driver](https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/commit/a047be85247755cdbe0acce6f1dafc8beb84f2ac).

Due to an accidental space, it deleted `/usr` instead of just the particular directory.

### Exceptions:

If you do intend to delete a system directory, such as when working in a chroot or initramfs, you can disable this message with a directive:

```
#cb3-1# shellcheck disable=SC2114
#cb3-2rm -rf /usr 
```

Previous versions of shellcheck, up to and including 0.4.6, would ignore `rm` statements containing a `--` (an arbitrary convention). This is no longer the case.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
