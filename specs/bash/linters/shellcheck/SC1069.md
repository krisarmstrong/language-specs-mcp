## You need a space before the `[`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if[ -e file ]
#cb1-2then echo "exists"; fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ -e file ]
#cb2-2then echo "exists"; fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword immediately followed by a `[`. There needs to be a space between them.

### Exceptions:

None
