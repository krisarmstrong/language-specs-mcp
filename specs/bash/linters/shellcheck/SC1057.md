## Did you forget the `do` for this loop?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while read -r line
#cb1-2  echo $line
#cb1-3done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while read -r line
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  echo $line
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a loop that appears to be missing its `do` statement. Make sure the loop syntax is correct.

### Exceptions:

None.
