## Use `elif` instead of `else if`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Usage: ..."
#cb1-4else if [ "$#" -lt 2 ]
#cb1-5then
#cb1-6  echo "Missing operand"
#cb1-7fi
#cb1-8  
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Usage: ..."
#cb2-4elif [ "$#" -lt 2 ]
#cb2-5then
#cb2-6  echo "Missing operand"
#cb2-7fi
```

### Rationale:

Many languages allow alternate branches with `else if`, but `sh` is not one of them. Use `elif` instead.

### Exceptions:

`else if` is a valid (though confusing) way of nesting an `if` statement in a parent's `else`. If this is your intention, consider using canonical formatting by putting a linefeed between `else` and `if`.

This does not change the behavior of the script, but merely makes it more obvious to ShellCheck (and other humans) that you didn't expect the `else if` to behave the way it does in C. Alternatively, you can [ignore](ignore) it with no ill effects.

```
#cb3-1
#cb3-2if x
#cb3-3then
#cb3-4  echo "x"
#cb3-5else     # line break here
#cb3-6  if y
#cb3-7  then
#cb3-8    echo "y"
#cb3-9   fi 
#cb3-10fi
```
