## Use `[ x = y ]` to compare values (or quote `'=='` if literal).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if $var == value
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Match"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$var" = value ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Match"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an unquoted `==` after a word.

This was most likely supposed to be a comparison, so use square brackets as in the correct code.

### Exceptions:

If the `==` was supposed to be literal, you can quote it to make ShellCheck ignore it:

```
grep '===' file.js
```
