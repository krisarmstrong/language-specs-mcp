## Trying to do math? Use e.g. `[ $((i/2+7)) -ge 18 ]`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[ i / 2 + 7 -ge 18 ]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[ $((i / 2 + 7)) -ge 18 ]
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a loose `+*/%` in a test statement. This usually happens when trying to do arithmetic in a condition, but without using the arithmetic expansion construct `$((expression))`.

In C, `if (a+b == c)` is perfectly fine, but in sh this must be written to first expand the arithmetic operation like `if [ $((a+b)) = c ]`.

### Exceptions:

None.
