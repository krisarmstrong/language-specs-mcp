## `>=` is not a valid operator. Use `! a < b` instead.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ a >= b ]]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[[ ! a < b ]]
```

### Rationale:

The operators `<=` and `>=` are not supported by Bourne shells. Instead of "less than or equal", rewrite as "not greater than".

### Exceptions

None
