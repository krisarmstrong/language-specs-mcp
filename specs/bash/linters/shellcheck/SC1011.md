## This apostrophe terminated the single quoted string!

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo 'Nothing so needs reforming as other peoples' habits.'
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo 'Nothing so needs reforming as other peoples'\'' habits.'
```

or

```
#cb3-1echo "Nothing so needs reforming as other peoples' habits."
```

### Rationale:

When writing a string in single-quotes, you have to make sure that any apostrophes in the text don't accidentally terminate the single-quoted string prematurely.

Escape them properly (see the correct code) or switch quotes to avoid the problem.

### Additional options:

```
#cb4-1echo '...peoples\ habits.'
#cb4-2...peoples\ habits.
```

```
#cb5-1$ echo $'...peoples\x27 habits.'
#cb5-2...peoples' habits.
```

### Exceptions:

None.
