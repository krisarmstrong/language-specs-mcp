## Quote expansions in case patterns to match literally rather than as a glob.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1case $input in
#cb1-2  -       ) echo "Reading from stdin..." ;;
#cb1-3  $output ) echo "Input should be different from output" ;;
#cb1-4esac
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1case $input in
#cb2-2  -         ) echo "Reading from stdin..." ;;
#cb2-3  "$output" ) echo "Input should be different from output" ;;
#cb2-4esac
```

### Rationale:

When unquoted variables and command expansions are used in case branch patterns, they will be interpreted as globs.

This can lead to some surprising behavior, such as `case $x in $x) trigger;; esac` not triggering in some cases, such as when `x='Pride and Prejudice [1813].epub'`.

To match the literal content of the variable or expansion, make sure to double quote the expansion.

### Exceptions:

If you intended to match a dynamically generated pattern, you can ignore this suggestion with a directive.
