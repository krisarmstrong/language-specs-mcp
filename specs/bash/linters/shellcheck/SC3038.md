## In POSIX sh, exec flags are undefined.

(or "In dash, ... are not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2exec -ca ls busybox
```

### Correct code:

Switch to a shell that does support the `exec` flags you are using, like `bash`:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2exec -ca ls busybox
```

In POSIX, you can use `env` to start a command with a clean environment, but there is no way to generally specifying the zeroth argument.

### Rationale:

Flags to `exec` are bash and ksh extensions. `dash` and POSIX `sh` does not support them.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
