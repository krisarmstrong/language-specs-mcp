## Ksh does not support `|&`. Use `2>&1 |`

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/usr/bin/ksh
#cb1-2make |& tee ~/log
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/usr/bin/ksh
#cb2-2make 2>&1 | tee ~/log
```

### Rationale:

You are using the Bash specific shorthand `|&`, but your script is running with Ksh. Rewrite it to its full, POSIX-compatible form as shown in the example.

### Exceptions:

None
