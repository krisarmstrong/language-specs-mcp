## Double quotes must be outside `${}`: `${"invalid"}` vs `"${valid}"`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo ${"USER"}
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "${USER}"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a parameter expansion containing what appears to be a quoted variable name.

While the parameter expansion itself must be quoted, as in `"${valid}"`, the quotes may not appear inside the `{}` as in `${"invalid"}`.

Also note that translated strings like `$"Hello"` may not use curly braces.

### Exceptions:

None
