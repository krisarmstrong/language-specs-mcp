## Parsing stopped here. Is this keyword correctly matched up?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if true
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo hello
#cb1-4fi
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if true
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo hello
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

This error is typically seen when there are too many `fi`, `done` or `esac`s, or when there's a `do` or `then` without a corresponding `while`, `for` or `if`. This is often due to deleting a loop or conditional statement but not its terminator.

In some cases, it can even be caused by bad quoting:

```
#cb3-1var="foo
#cb3-2if [[ $var = "bar ]
#cb3-3then
#cb3-4  echo true
#cb3-5fi
```

In this case, the `if` ends up inside the double quotes, leaving the `then` dangling.

### Exceptions:

None.
