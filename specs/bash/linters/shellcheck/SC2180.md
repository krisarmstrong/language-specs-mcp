## Bash does not support multidimensional arrays. Use 1D or associative arrays.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1foo[1][2]=bar
#cb1-2echo "${foo[1][2]}"
```

### Correct code:

In bash4, consider using associative arrays:

```
#cb2-1declare -A foo
#cb2-2foo[1,2]=bar
#cb2-3echo "${foo[1,2]}"
```

Otherwise, do your own index arithmetic:

```
#cb3-1size=10
#cb3-2foo[1*size+2]=bar
#cb3-3echo "${foo[1*size+2]}"
```

### Rationale:

Bash does not support multidimensional arrays. Rewrite it to use 1D arrays. Associative arrays map arbitrary strings to values, and are therefore useful since you can construct keys like `"1,2,3"` or `"val1;val2;val3"` to index them.

### Exceptions:

None.
