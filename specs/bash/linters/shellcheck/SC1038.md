## Shells are space sensitive. Use `< <(cmd)`, not `<<(cmd)`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while IFS= read -r line
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  printf "%q\n" "$line"
#cb1-4done <<(curl -s http://example.com)
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while IFS= read -r line
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  printf "%q\n" "$line"
#cb2-4done <  <(curl -s http://example.com)
```

### Rationale:

You are using `<<(` which is an invalid construct.

You probably meant to redirect `<` from process substitution `<(..)` instead. To do this, a space is needed between the `<` and `<(..)`, i.e. `< <(cmd)`.

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
