## Use `elif` to start another branch.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if false
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "hi"
#cb1-4elseif true
#cb1-5then
#cb1-6  echo "ho"
#cb1-7fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if false
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "hi"
#cb2-4elif true
#cb2-5then
#cb2-6  echo "ho"
#cb2-7fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck noticed that you appear to be using `elseif` or `elsif` as a keyword. This is not valid.

`sh` instead uses `elif` as its alternative branch keyword.

### Exceptions:

If you have made your own function called `elseif` and intend to call it, you can ignore this message.
