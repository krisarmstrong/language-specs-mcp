## Named class needs outer `[]`, e.g. `[:digit:](:digit:)`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1gzip file[:digit:]*.txt
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1gzip file[:digit:](:digit:)*.txt
```

### Rationale:

Predefined character groups are supposed to be used inside character ranges. `[:digit:]` matches one of "digt:" just like `[abc]` matches one of "abc". `[:digit:](:digit:)` matches a digit.

### Exceptions

When passing an argument to `tr` which parses these by itself without relying on globbing, you should quote it instead, e.g. `tr -d '[:digit:]'`
