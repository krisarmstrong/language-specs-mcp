## When used with `-p`, `-m` only applies to the deepest directory.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1mkdir -p -m 0755 foo/bar/baz
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1mkdir -p foo/bar/baz
#cb2-2chmod 0755 foo/bar/baz foo/bar foo
```

### Rationale:

When using `-m 0755`, the mode of the directory created will be set to 0755. When using `-p`, parent directories which do not exist will be created, but the mode specified by `-m` will only be used on the last directory. The parent directories will get their access mode the default way, via [umask(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umask.2.html).

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck does not warn if the path only has one component, as in `mkdir -p -m 0755 mydir`, but will not attempt to determine whether this applies for a variable as in `mkdir -p -m 0755 "$mydir"`. You can mkdir/chmod separately or [ignore](ignore) this message.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
