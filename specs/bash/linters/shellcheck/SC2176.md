## `time` is undefined for pipelines. time single stage or `bash -c` instead.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1time foo | bar
```

### Correct code:

To time the most relevant stage:

```
#cb2-1foo | { time bar; }
```

To time everything in a pipeline:

```
#cb3-1time bash -c 'foo | bar'
```

Note that you can not use `time sh -c` to time an entire pipeline, because POSIX does not guarantee that anything other than the last stage is waited upon by the shell.

### Rationale:

This behavior is explicitly left undefined [in
POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/time.html).

### Exceptions:

None. This warning is not emitted in `ksh` or `bash` where `time` is defined for pipelines.
