## BusyBox `[[ .. ]]` does not support glob matching. Use a case statement.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/busybox sh
#cb1-2if [[ $1 == https:* ]]
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4  echo "Using URL $1"
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/busybox sh
#cb2-2case "$1" in
#cb2-3  https:*)
#cb2-4    echo "Using URL $1" 
#cb2-5    ;;
#cb2-6esac
```

### Rationale:

You are using `[[ .. ]]` in BusyBox `sh` to match against a glob pattern. This is supported in Bash and Ksh, but not in BusyBox.

Rewrite the match to use a `case` statement instead.

### Exceptions:

None.
