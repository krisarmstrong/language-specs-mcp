## Add a linefeed between end token and terminating `)`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var=$(fmt -s "$COLUMNS" << "eof"
#cb1-2This is a bunch of text
#cb1-3eof)
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var=$(fmt -s "$COLUMNS" << "eof"
#cb2-2This is a bunch of text
#cb2-3eof
#cb2-4)
```

### Rationale:

When embedding a here document in `$(..)` or `(..)`, there needs to be a linefeed (newline) between the here doc token and the closing `)`. Please insert one.

Failing to do so may cause warnings like this:

```
bash: warning: here-document at line 15 delimited by end-of-file (wanted `eof')`
dash: 5: Syntax error: end of file unexpected (expecting ")")
```

### Exceptions:

This error may be incorrectly emitted for `ksh`, where this is allowed. In this case, please either write it in a standard way or ignore this warning.
