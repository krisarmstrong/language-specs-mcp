## You need a space or linefeed between the function name and body.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1function foo{
#cb1-2  echo "hello world"
#cb1-3}
```

### Correct code:

Prefer POSIX syntax:

```
#cb2-1foo() {
#cb2-2  echo "hello world"
#cb2-3}
```

Alternatively, add the missing space between function name and opening `{`:

```
#cb3-1#           v-- Here
#cb3-2function foo {
#cb3-3  echo "hello world"
#cb3-4}
```

### Rationale:

When using `function` keyword function definitions without `()`, a space is required between the function name and the opening `{`.

### Exceptions:

None.
