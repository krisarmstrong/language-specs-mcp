## This function is never invoked. Check usage (or ignored if invoked indirectly).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2f() {
#cb1-3  echo "Hello World"
#cb1-4}
#cb1-5exit
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2f() {
#cb2-3  echo "Hello World"
#cb2-4}
#cb2-5f
#cb2-6exit
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a function that goes out of scope before it's ever invoked. Verify that the function is called. It could be misspelled, or its invocation could also be unreachable (as in `f() { ..; }; exit; f`).

Note that if the example script did not end in `exit`, this warning would not be emitted. This is because the function could be invoked by another script that `source`s it.

### Exceptions:

ShellCheck is currently bad at figuring out functions that are invoked via `trap`. In such cases, please [ignore](ignore) the message with a directive.
