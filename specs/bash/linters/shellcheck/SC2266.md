## Use `||` for logical OR. Single `|` will pipe.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$1" = "--verbose" ] | [ "$1" = "-v" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  verbose=1
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$1" = "--verbose" ] || [ "$1" = "-v" ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  verbose=1
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a `test` command followed by a `|`. This was undoubtedly intended as a logical OR (`||`).

### Exceptions:

None
