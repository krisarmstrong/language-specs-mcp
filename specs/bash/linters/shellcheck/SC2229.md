## This does not read `foo`. Remove `$`/`${}` for that, or use `${var?}` to quiet.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1read $foo
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1read foo
```

### Rationale:

`read` takes a variable name, but ShellCheck has noticed that you give it an expanded variable instead. This will populate whatever the variable expands to instead of the variable itself. For example:

```
foo=bar
read $foo   # Reads data into 'bar', not into 'foo'
read foo    # Reads data into 'foo'
```

### Exceptions:

If this is intentional and you do want to read a variable through an indirect reference, you can silence this warning with a directive:

```
#cb4-1# shellcheck disable=SC2229
#cb4-2read "$foo"
```

Or take advantage of the fact that ShellCheck only warns when no parameter expansion modifiers are applied:

```
#cb5-1read "${foo}"    # ShellCheck warns
#cb5-2read "${foo?}"   # No warning
```

`${foo?}` fails when `foo` is unset, which is fine since `read` would have failed too. The main side effect is an improved runtime error message in that case.
