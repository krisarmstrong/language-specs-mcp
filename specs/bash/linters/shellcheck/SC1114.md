## Remove leading spaces before the shebang.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1  #!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "Hello world"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Rationale:

The script has leading spaces before the shebang (`#!`). This is not allowed.

The `#!` should be the first two bytes in the file, as they're used as a file signature by the OS to determine whether a file is a script.

### Exceptions:

None.
