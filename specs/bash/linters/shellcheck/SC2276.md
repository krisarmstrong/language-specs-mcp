## This is interpreted as a command name containing `=`. Bad assignment or comparison?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1"$var"=42
#cb1-2if "$var"=42
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4  true
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var=42
#cb2-2if [ "$var" = 42 ]
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4  true
#cb2-5fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command name containing an unquoted equals sign `=`. This was likely intended as either a comparison or an assignment.

To compare two values, use e.g. `[ "$var" = "42" ]`

To assign a value, use e.g. `var="42"`

### Exceptions:

None, though you can quote the `=` to make ShellCheck ignore it: `"$var=42"`.
