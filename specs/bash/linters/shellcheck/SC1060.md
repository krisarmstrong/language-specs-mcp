## Can't have empty do clauses (use `true` as a no-op)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for i in 1 2 3; do
#cb1-2done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for i in 1 2 3; do
#cb2-2  true
#cb2-3done
```

### Rationale:

An empty `do ... done` block is not valid. Use `true` or `:` if you need no command at all.

### Exceptions:

None.
