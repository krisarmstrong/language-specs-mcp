## You need a space before the `#`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1while sleep 1
#cb1-2do# show time
#cb1-3  date
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1while sleep 1
#cb2-2do # show time
#cb2-3  date
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has noticed that you have a keyword immediately followed by a `#`. In order for the `#` to start a comment, it needs to come after a word boundary such as a space.

### Exceptions:

None.
