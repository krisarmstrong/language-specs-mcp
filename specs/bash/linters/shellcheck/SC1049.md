## Did you forget the `then` for this `if`?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if true
#cb1-2  echo "foo"
#cb1-3elif true
#cb1-4  echo "bar"
#cb1-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if true
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "foo"
#cb2-4elif true
#cb2-5then
#cb2-6  echo "bar"
#cb2-7fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a parsing error in the script, and determined that it's most likely due to a missing `then` keyword for the `if` or `elif` indicated.

Make sure the `then` is there.

Note that the `then` needs a `;` or linefeed before it. `if true then` is invalid, while `if true; then` is correct.

### Exceptions:

None
