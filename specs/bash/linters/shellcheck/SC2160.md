## Instead of `[ true ]`, just use `true`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ true ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "always triggers"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if true
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "always triggers"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

This is a stylistic suggestion to use `true` instead of `[ true ]`.

`[ true ]` seems to suggest that the value "true" is somehow relevant to the statement. This is not the case, it doesn't matter. You can replace it with `[ false ]` or `[ wombat ]`, and it will still always be true:

It's therefore better to use it without brackets, so that the "true" actually matters.

### Exceptions:

None.
