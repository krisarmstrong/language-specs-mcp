## Missing `$` on a `$((..))` expression? (or use `( (` for arrays).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var=((foo+1))
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var=$((foo+1))
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be missing the `$` on an assignment from an arithmetic expression `var=$((..))` .

Without the `$`, this is an array expression which is either nested (ksh) or invalid (bash).

### Exceptions:

If you are trying to define a multidimensional Ksh array, add spaces between the `( (` to clarify:

```
var=( (1 2 3) (4 5 6) )
```
