## Variable names can't start with numbers, so this is interpreted as a command.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1411toppm=true
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1_411toppm=true
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be assigning to a variable name that starts with a digit. This is not allowed: variables must start with A-Z, a-z or _.

Switch to a variable name that does not start with a digit.

### Exceptions:

None
