## In POSIX sh, `/dev/{tcp,udp}` is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo foo > /dev/tcp/myhost/1234
```

### Correct code:

Rewrite using a tool like netcat (`nc`):

```
#cb2-1echo foo | nc myhost 1234
```

### Rationale:

`/dev/tcp/$host/$port` and `/dev/udp/$host/$port` are recognized in redirections by bash and ksh, and a socket connection is made instead of opening a file. They do not physically exist in `/dev`.

POSIX sh and dash do not support this, so any such code should be rewritten to use a socket tool explicitly. The obvious candidate is netcat aka `nc`.

### Exceptions:

None
