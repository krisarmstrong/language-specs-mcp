## In POSIX sh, extglob is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2rm !(*.hs)
```

### Correct code:

Either switch the shebang to a shell that does support extglob, like `bash` or `ksh`, or rewrite in terms of a loop with a `case` or `grep` match:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2for file in *
#cb2-3do
#cb2-4  case "$file" in
#cb2-5    *.hs) true;;
#cb2-6    *) rm "$file" ;;
#cb2-7  esac
#cb2-8done
```

### Rationale:

Extglobs are extensions in bash and ksh, while your shebang says you're using `sh` or `dash`.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
