## Expected `do`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for file in *
#cb1-2  echo "$file"
#cb1-3done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for file in *
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  echo "$file"
#cb2-4done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found a loop that appears to be missing a `do` statement. In the problematic code, it was simply forgotten.

Verify that the `do` exists, and that it's in the correct place.

### Exceptions:

None
