## Brace expansions and globs are literal in assignments. Quote it or use an array.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1foo={1..9}
#cb1-2echo "$foo"
```

```
#cb2-1foo="/some/path/*"
#cb2-2echo "$foo"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1foo=( {1..9} )
#cb3-2echo "${foo[@]}"
```

```
#cb4-1foo=(/some/path/*)
#cb4-2echo "${foo[@]}"
```

Note that either of these will trigger [SC3030](SC3030) ("In POSIX sh, array references are undefined") if you are using `sh` and not e.g. `bash`.

### Rationale:

`echo *.png {1..9}` expands to all png files and numbers from 1 to 9, but `var=*.png` or `var={1..9}` will just assign the literal strings `'*.png'` and `'{1..9}'`.

To make the variable contain all png files or 1 through 9, use an array as demonstrated.

If you intended to assign these values as literals, quote them (e.g. `var="*.png"`).

### Exceptions

None.
