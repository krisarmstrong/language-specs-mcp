## `[ 0 ]` is true. Use `false` instead.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ 0 ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "always triggers"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if false
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "never triggers"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

`[ str ]` checks whether `str` is non-empty. It doesn't matter if `str` is `0`, it will still be evaluated for non-emptyness.

Instead, use the command `false` which -- as the manual puts it -- does nothing, unsuccessfully.

### Exceptions:

None
