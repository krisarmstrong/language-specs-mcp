## This redirection doesn't have a command. Move to its command (or use `true` as no-op).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1{ 
#cb1-2  echo "Report for $(date +%F)"
#cb1-3  uptime
#cb1-4  df -h
#cb1-5}
#cb1-6  > report.txt
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1{ 
#cb2-2  echo "Report for $(date +%F)"
#cb2-3  uptime
#cb2-4  df -h
#cb2-5} > report.txt
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a redirection that doesn't actually redirect from/to anything.

This could indicate a bug, such as in the problematic code where an additional linefeed causes `report.txt` to be truncated instead of containing report output, or in `foo & > bar`, where either `foo &> bar` or `foo > bar &` was intended.

However, it could also be intentionally used to truncate a file or check that it's readable. You can make this more explicit for both ShellCheck and human readers by using `true` or `:` as a dummy command, e.g. `true > file` or `: > file`.

### Exceptions:

There are no semantic problems with using `> foo` over `true > foo`, so if you don't see this as a potential source of bugs or confusion, you can [ignore](ignore) it.
