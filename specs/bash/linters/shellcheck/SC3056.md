## In POSIX sh, name matching prefixes are undefined.

(or "In dash, ... are not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "${!ANDROID_*}"
```

### Correct code:

The easiest solution is to switch to a shell that does support name matching prefixes, like `bash`:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2echo "${!ANDROID_*}"
```

Alternatively, extract the data you want from `env` or `set`

### Rationale:

Using `${!name*}` to find all variable names with a given prefix is a bash and ksh extension that `dash` and POSIX `sh` does not support.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
