## You need at least one command here. Use `true;` as a no-op.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1submitbug() {
#cb1-2  # TODO: Implement me
#cb1-3}
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1submitbug() {
#cb2-2  # TODO: Implement me
#cb2-3  true
#cb2-4}
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an empty code block. This could be an empty function as shown, a loop with an empty body, or similar.

Sh/bash does not allow empty code blocks. Insert at least one command. If you don't want the block to do anything, `true` (aka `:`) is a good no-op.

### Exceptions:

None
