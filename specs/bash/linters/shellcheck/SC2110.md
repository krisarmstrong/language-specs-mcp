## In `[..](..)`, use `||` instead of `-o`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[[ "$1" = "-v" -o "$1" = "-help" ]]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[[ "$1" = "-v" || "$1" = "-help" ]]
```

### Rationale:

`-o` for logical OR is not supported in a `[[ .. ]]` expression. Use `||` instead.

### Exceptions:

None.
