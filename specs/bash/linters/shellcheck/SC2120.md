# foo references arguments, but none are ever passed.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1sayhello() {
#cb1-2  echo "Hello $1"
#cb1-3}
#cb1-4sayhello
```

`./myscript World` just prints "Hello " instead of "Hello World".

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1sayhello() {
#cb2-2  echo "Hello $1"
#cb2-3}
#cb2-4sayhello "$@"
```

`./myscript World` now prints "Hello World".

### Rationale:

In a function, `$1` and up refers to the function's parameters, not the script's parameters.

If you want to process your script's parameters in a function, you have to explicitly pass them. You can do this with `myfunction "$@"`.

Note that `"$@"` refers to the current context's positional parameters, so if you call a function from a function, you have to pass in `"$@"` to both of them:

```
#cb3-1first() { second "$@"; }
#cb3-2second() { echo "The first script parameter is: $1"; }
#cb3-3first "$@"
```

### Exceptions

If the parameters are optional and you currently just don't want to use them, you can ignore this message. In versions strictly greater than v0.6.0, ignoring SC2120 on a function will also disable SC2119 on each of the call sites.
