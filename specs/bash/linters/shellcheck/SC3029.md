## In POSIX sh, `|&` in place of `2>&1 |` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2make |& tee ~/log
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to bash:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2make 2>&1 | tee ~/log
```

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash.

In this case, the non-portable shorthand `|&` to pipe both stdout and stderr can be easily replaced with its written out form `2>&1 |` as shown.

### Exceptions:

None
