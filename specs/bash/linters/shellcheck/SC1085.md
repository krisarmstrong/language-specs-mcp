## Did you forget to move the ;; after extending this case item?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1case $options in
#cb1-2  foobar) echo foo ;; echo bar;;
#cb1-3  *) echo unknown option ;;
#cb1-4esac
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1case $options in
#cb2-2  foobar) echo foo ; echo bar;;
#cb2-3  *) echo unknown option ;;
#cb2-4esac
```

### Rationale:

There should be no statements between `;;` and the next case item.
