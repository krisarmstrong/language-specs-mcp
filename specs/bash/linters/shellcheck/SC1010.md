## Use semicolon or linefeed before `done` (or quote to make it literal).

(or `do``then`, `fi`, `esac`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for f in *; do echo "$f" done
```

or

```
#cb2-1echo $f is done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1for f in *; do echo "$f"; done
```

or

```
#cb4-1echo "$f is done"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword like `done`, `then`, `fi`, `esac`, etc used as the argument of a command. This means that the shell will interpret it as a literal string rather than a shell keyword. To be interpreted as a keyword, it must be the first word in the line (i.e. after `;`, `&` or a linefeed).

In the example, `echo "$f" done` is the same as `echo "$f" "done"`, and the `done` does not terminate the loop. This is fixed by terminating the `echo` command with a `;` so that the `done` is the first word in the next line.

### Exceptions

If you're intentionally using `done` as a literal, you can quote it to make this clear to ShellCheck (and also human readers), e.g. instead of `echo Task is done`, use `echo "Task is done"`. This makes no difference to the shell, but it will silence this warning.

From POSIX-2018, section "C.2.10 Shell Grammar," regarding the syntax, `if (false) then (echo x) else (echo y) fi`: [https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xcu_chap02.html#tag_23_02_10](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xcu_chap02.html#tag_23_02_10)
