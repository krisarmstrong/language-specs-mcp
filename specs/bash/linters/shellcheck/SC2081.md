## `[ .. ]` can't match globs. Use `[[ .. ]]` or grep.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ $var == *[^0-9]* ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "$var is not numeric"
#cb1-4fi 
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [[ $var == *[^0-9]* ]]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "$var is not numeric"
#cb2-4fi 
```

### Rationale:

`[ .. ]` aka `test` can not match against globs.

In bash/ksh, you can instead use `[[ .. ]]` which supports this behavior.

In sh, you can rewrite to use `grep`.

```
#cb3-1if echo $var | grep -q '^[0-9]*$'; then
#cb3-2  echo "$var is numeric"
#cb3-3fi
```

### Exceptions:

None. If you are not trying to match a glob, quote the argument (e.g. `[ $var == '*' ]` to match literal asterisk.
