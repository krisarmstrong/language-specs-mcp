## You need a space before the `]` or `]]`

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$STUFF" = ""]; then
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$STUFF" = "" ]; then
```

### Rationale:

Bourne shells are very whitespace sensitive. Adding or removing spaces can drastically alter the meaning of a script. In these cases, ShellCheck has noticed that you're missing a space at the position indicated.

### Exceptions

None.

### Ignore

```
#cb3-1# shellcheck disable=SC1020
#cb3-2if [ "$STUFF" = ""]; then
```
