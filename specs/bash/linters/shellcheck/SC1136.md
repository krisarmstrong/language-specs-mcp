## Unexpected characters after terminating `]`. Missing semicolon/linefeed?

Note: Removed in [V0.7.2
2021-04-20](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/commit/8e332ce87978e6f6afdfabcc15b382983ea32550)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ -e "foo.txt" ]: then
#cb1-2  echo "Exists"
#cb1-3fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ -e "foo.txt" ]; then
#cb2-2  echo "Exists"
#cb2-3fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found unexpected characters after the `]` or `]]` in a `test` expression. In the example, a colon was accidentally used instead of a semicolon.

Similarly, a missing space before a comment (`[ -e foo ]#comment`), an additional square bracket (`[[ -e foo ]]]`), or a missing semicolon before a `then` on the same line (`if [ foo ]then`) can cause this warning.

Make sure the `]` or `]]` is not immediately followed by another shell word character.

### Exceptions:

None
