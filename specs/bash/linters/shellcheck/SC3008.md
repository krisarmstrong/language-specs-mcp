## In POSIX sh, select loops are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo "Select file to show"
#cb1-3select input in *
#cb1-4do
#cb1-5  ls -l "$input"
#cb1-6done
```

### Correct code:

Either switch to bash:

```
#cb2-1#!/usr/bin/env bash
#cb2-2echo "Select file to show"
#cb2-3select input in *
#cb2-4do
#cb2-5  ls -l "$input"
#cb2-6done
```

Or write your own menu.

### Rationale:

Your script uses a shell feature not supported by the shebang. Either rewrite the script to be portable, or change the shebang to explicitly require a shell like Bash. There is no simple substitution for a `select` loop, so either write your own using compatible constructs like `for` loops, or switch to a shell that supports them.

### Exceptions:

None
