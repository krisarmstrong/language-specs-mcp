## Prefer explicit `-n` to check non-empty string (or use `=`/`-ne` to check boolean/integer).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$1" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "True"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# Check if $1 is empty or non-empty
#cb2-2if [ -n "$1" ]
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4  echo "True, $1 is a non-empty value"
#cb2-5fi
#cb2-6
#cb2-7# Check instead if $1 is true or false, as in Java
#cb2-8[ "$1" = "true" ]
#cb2-9
#cb2-10# Check instead if $1 is non-zero or zero, as in C
#cb2-11[ "$1" -ne 0 ]
#cb2-12
#cb2-13# Check instead if $1 is defined (even if just assigned the empty string) or undefined
#cb2-14[ "${1+x}" = "x" ]
```

### Rationale:

`[ "$var" ]` is equivalent to `[ -n "$var" ]` and checks that a string is non-empty.

Users more familiar with other languages are often surprised to learn that `[ "$var" ]` is true when:

- `var=false`
- `var=0`
- `var=null`
- `var=" "`

Adding the explicit `-n` helps clarify that this is a string comparison, and not related to any concept of boolean values or "truthiness" as it is in most languages.

### Exceptions:

If you are familiar with the semantics of `[`, you can [ignore](ignore) this stylistic suggestion with no ill effects.
