## This directive is unknown. It will be ignored.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1# shellcheck foobar=baz
#cb1-2echo "Hello World"
```

### Correct code:

Depends on your intention.

### Rationale:

ShellCheck doesn't recognize the [directive](directive) you're trying to use in a `# shellcheck` comment. See the [Directive](Directive)s page for supported directives.

It could be misspelled, or you could be using an older version of shellcheck that doesn't support it yet.

### Exceptions:

None. If you wish to ignore this warning and continue without it, you need version 0.4.5 (commit 88c56ec) or later and a command grouping:

```
#cb2-1# Ignore an unrecognized directive in 0.4.5 or later:
#cb2-2# shellcheck disable=SC1107
#cb2-3{
#cb2-4  # shellcheck unrecognized=directive
#cb2-5  echo "Hello World"
#cb2-6}
```

Before 0.4.5, unrecognized directives are considered parse errors.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
