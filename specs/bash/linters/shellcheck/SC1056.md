## Expected a `}`. If you have one, try a `;` or `\n` in front of it.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/bash
#cb1-2bar() { echo "hello world" }
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2bar() { echo "hello world";}
```

### Rationale:

`}` is only recognized as the end of a command group when it's a separate token.

If it's not a separate token, like in the problematic example, it will be considered a literal character, as if writing `echo "foo}"` with quotes, and therefore usually cause a syntax error.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
