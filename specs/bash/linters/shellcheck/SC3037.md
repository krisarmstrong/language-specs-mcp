## In POSIX sh, echo flags are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2echo -ne 'Foo:\tBar'
```

### Correct code:

Rewrite in terms of the more robust and standardized `printf`:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/sh
#cb2-2printf 'Foo:\tBar'
```

### Rationale:

`echo` has historically behaved differently on different systems. Use `printf` instead to ensure compatibility between shells.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target systems that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
