## Expected `then`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if true
#cb1-2  echo "True"
#cb1-3fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if true
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "True"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck has found an `if` statement that appears to be missing a `then`.

Make sure the `then` exists, and that it is the first word of the line (or immediately preceded by a semicolon).

### Exceptions:

None
