## In POSIX sh, test -N is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ -N file ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "File has been modified since last read"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if bash -c '[ -N file ]'
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "File has been modified since last read"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

`test -N` is not supported by POSIX, and there is no straight forward way of simulating it. If you need this functionality, look into which non-POSIX features your system has to allow this. `stat -c`, `find -printf`, bash, ksh, and Python are all possible options.

Note that `atime` did not turn out to be as useful as first imagined in 1970, and it's generally better not to rely on it.

### Exceptions:

None. If you expect your shell to support `test -N`, either explicitly specify it in the shebang, use a `# shellcheck shell=bash` directive, or ignore this warning.
