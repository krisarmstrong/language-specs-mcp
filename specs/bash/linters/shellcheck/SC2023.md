## The shell may override `time` as seen in man time(1). Use `command time ..` for that one.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1time -some some
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1command time -some some
```

### Rationale:

`time` is a built-in command. If you would like to use `time` from `$PATH`, you need to use `command` to execute it as a regular command.

### Exceptions:

None
