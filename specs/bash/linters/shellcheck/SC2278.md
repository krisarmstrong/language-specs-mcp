## `$0` can't be assigned in Ksh (but it does reflect the current function).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/ksh
#cb1-2$0=myname
#cb1-3echo "Usage: $0 --help"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/ksh
#cb2-2myname() {
#cb2-3  echo "Usage: $0 --help"
#cb2-4}
#cb2-5myname
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be trying to assign a new value to `$0` in Ksh.

This is not possible. However, `$0` will reflect the current function name, so if you wrap your code in a function with your chosen name, you can have `$0` expand to it.

### Exceptions:

If you instead wanted to compare the value of `$0`, use a comparison like `[ "$0" = "myname" ]`.
