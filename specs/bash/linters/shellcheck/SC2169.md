## In dash, something is not supported.

Note: This warning has been retired in favor of individual SC3xxx warnings for each individual issue. Removed in [V0.7.2
- 2021-04-19](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/commit/cfd68ee0c2ebfd0ab08a1d4bf628162b454dc207)

You are writing a script for `dash`, but you're using a feature that `dash` doesn't support. See [SC2039](SC2039), the equivalent warning for POSIX sh, for possible workarounds.

See also Ubuntu's [DashAsBinSh](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh) migration guide for how to make bash-specific scripts dash-compatible.
