## This is a Unicode single quote. Delete and retype it.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo ‘hello world’
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo 'hello world'
```

### Rationale:

Some software, like macOS, Microsoft Word, and WordPress, may automatically replace your regular quotes with slanted Unicode quotes. Try deleting and retyping them, and/or disable “smart quotes” in your editor or OS.

### Status:

This error was retired after 0.4.5. In this version and earlier, ShellCheck parsed slanted quotes as a valid double-quote. This meant that the warning could not simply be ignored. It has since been replaced by [SC1110](SC1110) (outside quotes) and [SC1112](SC1112) (inside single-quotes).

### Exceptions

If you want to use typographic single-quotes, you can put them in double-quotes (or typographic double-quotes in single-quotes) to make ShellCheck ignore them, e.g.,

```
#cb3-1printf "Warning: ‘wakeonlan’ is not installed.\n"
```
