## Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required.

### Optional - `require-variable-braces`

This is an [optional](optional) rule, which means that it has a special "long name" and is not enabled by default. See the [optional](optional) page for more details. In short, you have to enable it with the long name instead of the "SC" code like you would with a normal rule:

#### `.shellcheckrc`

```
enable=require-variable-braces # SC2250
```

## Problematic code:

```
partial_path='example'

curl "http://example.com/$partial_path_version/explain.html"
```

## Correct code:

```
partial_path='example'

curl "http://example.com/${partial_path}_version/explain.html"
```

## Rationale:

If a variable gets called, and there is a string that gets appended to the variable that could get misinterpreted as possibly part of the name of the variable. Then it will not call the right variable.
