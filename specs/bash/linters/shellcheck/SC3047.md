## In POSIX sh, trapping ERR is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

Also applies to RETURN and DEBUG.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2trap 'Command failed with $?' ERR
```

### Correct code:

Switch to a shell like `ksh` or `bash` that does support the kind of trap you want:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2trap 'Command failed with $?' ERR
```

Otherwise, rewrite the script to not rely on the trap.

### Rationale:

You are trying to install a trap that is not supported by your current shell (`dash` or POSIX `sh`). There is no simple replacement. The script should be rewritten to avoid depending on the trap, or simply be run with a shell that supports it.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
