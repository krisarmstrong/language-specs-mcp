## In POSIX sh, standalone `((..))` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1variable=1
#cb1-2if ((variable)); then
#cb1-3  echo variable is not zero
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

[bash
supports standalone ((..))](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Conditional-Constructs.html#index-select) natively.

For POSIX compliance, use

```
#cb2-1variable=1
#cb2-2if [ "${variable}" != 0 ]; then
#cb2-3  echo variable is not zero
#cb2-4fi
```
