## Use `||` instead of `-o` between test commands.

And variations, like "Use `&&` instead of `and`".

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1if [ "$1" = "-v" ] -o [ -n "$VERBOSE" ]
#cb1-2then
#cb1-3  echo "Verbose log"
#cb1-4fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1if [ "$1" = "-v" ] || [ -n "$VERBOSE" ]
#cb2-2then
#cb2-3  echo "Verbose log"
#cb2-4fi
```

### Rationale:

You have a `[ .. ]` or `[[ .. ]]` test expression followed by `-o`/`-a` (or by Python-style `or`/`and`).

`-o` and `-a` work inside`[ .. ]`, but they do not work between them. The Python operators `or` and `and` are never recognized in Bash.

To join two separate test expressions, instead use `||` for "logical OR", or `&&` for "logical AND".

### Exceptions:

None
