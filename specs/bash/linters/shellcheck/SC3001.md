## In POSIX sh, process substitution is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2while IFS= read -r n
#cb1-3do
#cb1-4  sum=$((sum+n))
#cb1-5done < <(program)
```

### Correct code:

The easiest fix is to switch to a shell that does support process substitution, by changing the shebang to `#!/bin/bash` or `ksh`.

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2while IFS= read -r n
#cb2-3do
#cb2-4  sum=$((sum+n))
#cb2-5done < <(program)
```

Alternatively, process substitution can often be replaced with temporary files:

```
#cb3-1#!/bin/sh
#cb3-2tmp="$(mktemp)"
#cb3-3program > "$tmp"
#cb3-4while IFS= read -r n
#cb3-5do
#cb3-6  sum=$((sum+n))
#cb3-7done < "$tmp"
#cb3-8rm "$tmp"
```

If streaming is important, the temporary file can be a named pipe, and the producer or consumer can be run as a background job.

If the reading command accepts input from standard input, the process substitution can be replaced with a regular pipe:

```
#cb4-1#!/bin/sh
#cb4-2program | while IFS= read -r n
#cb4-3do
#cb4-4  sum=$((sum+n))
#cb4-5done
```

### Rationale:

Process substitution is a ksh and bash extension. It does not work in sh or dash scripts.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
