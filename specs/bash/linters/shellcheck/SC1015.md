## This is a Unicode double quote. Delete and retype it.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo “hello world”
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "hello world"
```

### Rationale:

Blog software and word processors frequently replaces ASCII quotes `""` with fancy Unicode quotes, `“”`. To Bash, Unicode quotes are considered regular literals and not quotes at all.

Simply delete them and retype them in your editor.

### Status:

This error was retired after 0.4.5. In this version and earlier, ShellCheck parsed slanted quotes as a valid double quote. This meant that the warning could not simply be ignored. It has since been replaced by [SC1110](SC1110) (outside quotes) and [SC1111](SC1111) (inside double-quotes).

### Exceptions

If you really want literal Unicode double quotes, you can put them in single-quotes (or Unicode single-quotes in double-quotes) to make ShellCheck ignore them, e.g.,

```
#cb3-1printf 'Warning: “wakeonlan” is not installed.\n'
```
