## In POSIX sh, arithmetic for loops are undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
#cb1-2do 
#cb1-3  echo "$i"
#cb1-4done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1i=0
#cb2-2while [ "$i" -lt 10 ]
#cb2-3do 
#cb2-4  echo "$i"
#cb2-5  i=$((i+1))
#cb2-6done
```

### Rationale:

C-style arithmetic for loops are a Ksh/Bash feature that's not supported by POSIX sh or dash. Use a `while` loop with separate initialization and incrementing instead.

### Exceptions:

None
