## You need a space before the :.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1until make
#cb1-2do:; done
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1until make
#cb2-2do :; done
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a keyword immediately followed by a `:`. `:` is a synonym for `true`, the command that "does nothing, successfully", and as a command name it needs a space.

`do:` is as invalid as `dotrue`. Use `do :`, or preferably, `do true` for readability.

### Exceptions:

None
