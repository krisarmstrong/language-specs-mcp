## `a[(x)]` is the same as `a[x]`. Prefer not wrapping in additional parentheses.

Similarly `$(( (x) ))` is the same as `$(( x ))`, `(( (x) ))` is the same as `(( x ))`.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1array[(x+1)]=val
#cb1-2echo $(( (x+1) ))
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1array[x+1]=val
#cb2-2echo $((x+1))
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an entire arithmetic expression wrapped in parentheses. This does not serve a purpose since the expression is already clearly delimited by the construct it's in, such as `array[..]=` or `$((..))` in the example.

Note: ShellCheck does not warn about redundant parentheses in subexpressions, such as `(a*b)+c`. Feel free to use parentheses to clarify the order of operations any way you'd like. ShellCheck only emits this suggestion when the entire expression is wrapped twice.

### Exceptions:

If you prefer having an extra layer of parentheses for stylistic reasons, you can [ignore](ignore) this message.
