## Was this intended as a comment? Use `#` in sh.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1// This is a comment.
#cb1-2/* This too. */
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# This is a comment.
#cb2-2# This too.
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found what appears to be a C-style comment, a line starting with `//` or `/*`.

In Bourne based shell scripts, the comment character is `#`

### Exceptions:

None.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
