## Did you mean `IFS=$'\t'` ?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1IFS="\t"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1IFS=$'\t'
```

or POSIX:

```
#cb3-1IFS="$(printf '\t')"
```

### Rationale:

`IFS="\t"` splits on backslash and the letter "t". `IFS=$'\t'` splits on tab.

### Exceptions

It's extremely rare to want to split on the letter "n" or "t", rather than linefeed or tab.
