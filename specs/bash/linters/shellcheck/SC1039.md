## Remove indentation before end token (or use `<<-` and indent with tabs).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1for f in *.png
#cb1-2do
#cb1-3  cat << HTML
#cb1-4     <img src="$f" /><br/>
#cb1-5  HTML
#cb1-6done > index.html
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1for f in *.png
#cb2-2do
#cb2-3  cat << HTML
#cb2-4     <img src="$f" /><br/>
#cb2-5HTML
#cb2-6done > index.html
```

### Rationale:

The here document delimiter will not be recognized if it is indented.

You can fix it in one of two ways:

1. Simply remove the indentation, even though this may break formatting.
2. Use `<<-` instead of `<<`, and indent the script with tabs only (spaces will not be recognized).

Removing the indentation is preferred, since the script won't suddenly break if it's reformatted, copy-pasted, or saved with a different editor.

### Exceptions:

If the line was supposed to be a literal part of the here document, consider choosing a less ambiguous token.
