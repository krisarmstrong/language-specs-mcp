## Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1cp $@ ~/dir
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1cp "$@" ~/dir
```

### Rationale:

Double quotes around `$@` (and similarly, `${array[@]}`) prevents globbing and word splitting of individual elements, while still expanding to multiple separate arguments.

Let's say you have four arguments: `baz`, `foo bar`, `*` and `/*/*/*/*`

`"$@"` will expand into exactly that: `baz`, `foo bar`, `*` and `/*/*/*/*`

`$@` will expand into multiple other arguments: `baz`, `foo`, `bar`, `file.txt`, `otherfile.jpg`, and (eventually) a list of most files on the system

Since the latter is rarely expected or desired, ShellCheck warns about it.

### Exceptions

When you want globbing of individual elements.
