## This word is outside of quotes. Did you intend to `'nest '"'single quotes'"'` instead?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1alias server_uptime='ssh $host 'uptime -p''
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1alias server_uptime='ssh $host '"'uptime -p'"
```

### Rationale:

In the first case, the user has four single quotes on a line, wishfully hoping that the shell will match them up as outer quotes around a string with literal single quotes:

```
#cb3-1#                   v--------match--------v
#cb3-2alias server_uptime='ssh $host 'uptime -p''
#cb3-3#                              ^--match--^
```

The shell, meanwhile, always terminates single quoted strings at the first possible single quote:

```
#cb4-1#                   v---match--v
#cb4-2alias server_uptime='ssh $host 'uptime -p''
#cb4-3#                                        ^^
```

Which is the same thing as `alias server_uptime='ssh $host uptime' -p`.

There is no way to nest single quotes. However, single quotes can be placed literally in double quotes, so we can instead concatenate a single quoted string and a double quoted string:

```
#cb5-1#                   v--match---v
#cb5-2alias server_uptime='ssh $host '"'uptime -p'"
#cb5-3#                               ^---match---^
```

This results in an alias with embedded single quotes.
