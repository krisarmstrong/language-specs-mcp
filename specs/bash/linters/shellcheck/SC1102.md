## Shells disambiguate `$((` differently or not at all. For `$(command substitution)`, add space after `$(` . For `$((arithmetics))`, fix parsing errors.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo "$((cmd "$@") 2>&1)"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1echo "$( (cmd "$@") 2>&1)"
```

### Rationale:

You appear to be using `$((` with two (or more) parentheses in a row, where the first `$(` should open a subshell.

This is an ill-defined structure that is parsed differently between different shells and shell versions. Prefer adding spaces to make it unambiguous, both to shells and humans.

Consider the `$(((` in `$(((1)) )`:

Ash, dash and Bash 1 parses it as `$(( (` and subsequently fail to find the matching `))`. Zsh and Bash 2+ looks ahead and parses it as `$( ((`. Ksh parses it as `$( ( (`.

### Exceptions:

Alternatively, you may indeed have correctly spaced your parentheses, but ShellCheck failed to parse `$((` as an arithmetic expression while accidentally succeeding in parsing it as `$(` + `(`.

In these cases, double check the syntax to ensure ShellCheck can parse the `$((`, or ignore this error and hope that it won't affect analysis too severely.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
