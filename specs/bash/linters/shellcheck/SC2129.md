## Consider using `{ cmd1; cmd2; } >> file` instead of individual redirects.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1echo foo >> file
#cb1-2date >> file
#cb1-3cat stuff  >> file
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1{
#cb2-2  echo foo
#cb2-3  date
#cb2-4  cat stuff
#cb2-5} >> file
```

### Rationale:

Rather than adding `>> something` after every single line, you can simply group the relevant commands and redirect the group. So the file has to be opened and closed only once and it means a performance gain.

### Exceptions:

This is mainly a stylistic issue, and can freely be ignored.

Note: shell traps which would ordinarily emit output to stdout or stderr on catching their condition will have output swallowed into the redirect when the trap is triggered from within the grouping.
