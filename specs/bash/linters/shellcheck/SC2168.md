## `local` is only valid in functions.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1local foo=bar
#cb1-2echo "$foo"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1foo=bar
#cb2-2echo "$foo"
```

### Rationale:

In Bash, `local` can only be used in functions. In other contexts, it's an error.

### Exceptions:

It's possible to source files containing `local` from a function context but not from any other context. This is not good practice, but in these cases you can [ignore](ignore) this error.
