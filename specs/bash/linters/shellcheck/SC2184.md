## Quote arguments to unset so they're not glob expanded.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1unset foo[index]
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1unset 'foo[index]'
```

### Rationale:

Arguments to `unset` are subject to regular glob expansion. This is especially relevant when unsetting indices in arrays, where `[..]` is considered a glob character group.

In the problematic code, having a file called `food` in the current directory will result in `unset foo[index]` expanding to `unset food`, which will silently succeed without unsetting the element.

Quoting so that the `[..]` is passed literally to `unset` solves the issue.

Note that you can unset element using variable for index name like this:

```
#cb3-1unset 'foo[$var]'
```

### Exceptions:

If you know that pathname expansion is disabled you can ignore this message. `set -o noglob` (and variations like invoking the script with `#!/bin/bash -f`) will prevent glob expansion of arguments to `unset`.
