## Remove spaces around `+=` to assign (or quote `'+='` if literal).

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var += "my text"
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var+="my text"
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found an unquoted `+=` after a word. To append text to a variable, remove spaces around `+=` as in the example.

### Exceptions:

If the `+=` was supposed to be literal, you can quote it to make ShellCheck ignore it:

```
grep '+=' files..
```
