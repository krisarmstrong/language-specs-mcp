## In POSIX sh, `local` is undefined.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1myfunc() {
#cb1-2  local i=0
#cb1-3  ..
#cb1-4}
```

### Correct code:

In POSIX sh, you can adopt some convention to avoid accidentally overwriting variables names, e.g. prefixing with the function name:

```
#cb2-1myfunc() {
#cb2-2  _myfunc_i=0
#cb2-3  ..
#cb2-4}
```

### Rationale:

`local` is supported in many shells, including bash, ksh, dash, and BusyBox ash. However, [it is not specified
by POSIX](https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=767).

### Exceptions:

Since quite a lot of real world shells support this feature, you may decide to [ignore](ignore) the warning.
