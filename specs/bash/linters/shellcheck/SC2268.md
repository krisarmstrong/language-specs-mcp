## Avoid x-prefix in comparisons as it no longer serves a purpose.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1[ "x$pass" = "xswordfish" ]
#cb1-2
#cb1-3test x"$var" = x 
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1[ "$pass" = "swordfish" ] 
#cb2-2
#cb2-3test "$var" = ""
```

### Rationale:

Some older shells would get confused if the first argument started with a dash, or consisted of `!` or `(`. As a workaround, people would prefix variables and values to be compared with `x` to ensure the left-hand side always started with an alphanumeric character.

POSIX ensures [this
is not necessary](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html), and all modern shells now follow suit.

### Examples:

Bash 1.14 from 1992 incorrectly fails this test. This was fixed for Bash 2.0 in 1996:

```
#cb3-1var='!'
#cb3-2[ "$var" = "!" ]
```

Dash 0.5.4 from 2007 incorrectly passes this test. This was fixed for Dash 0.5.5 in 2008:

```
#cb4-1x='(' y=')'
#cb4-2[ "$x" = "$y" ]
```

Zsh (while not supported by ShellCheck) fixed the same problem in 2015.

### Exceptions:

If you are targeting especially old shells, you can ignore this warning (or use a different letter).
