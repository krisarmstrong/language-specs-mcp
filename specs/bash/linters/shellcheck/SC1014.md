## Use `if cmd; then ..` to check exit code, or `if [ "$(cmd)" = .. ]` to check output.

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1# WRONG
#cb1-2if [ grep -q pattern file ]
#cb1-3then
#cb1-4  echo "Found a match"
#cb1-5fi
```

```
#cb2-1# WRONG
#cb2-2if ! [[ logname == $LOGNAME ]]
#cb2-3then
#cb2-4    echo "Possible `su` shell"
#cb2-5fi
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb3-1if grep -q pattern file
#cb3-2then
#cb3-3  echo "Found a match"
#cb3-4fi
```

```
#cb4-1if ! [[ $(logname) == $LOGNAME ]]
#cb4-2then
#cb4-3    echo "Possible `su` shell"
#cb4-4fi
```

### Rationale:

`[ ... ]` as shell syntax is a simple command that tests for whether certain conditions are true or false, such as whether the value assigned to a variable has a non-zero length (`[ -n "${foo}" ]`) or whether a file system object is a directory (`[ -d "${dir}" ]`). `If-then-(elif-then)-else-fi` statements are logical constructs which themselves contain lists of commands which can include simple commands.

`[` is just regular command, like `whoami` or `grep`, but with a funny name (see `ls -l /bin/[`). It's a shorthand for `test`. `[[` is similar to both `[` and `test`, but `[[` offers some additional unary operators, such as '=~' the regular expression comparison operator. It allows one to use extglobs such as `@(foo|bar)` (a "bashism"), among some other less commonly used features.

`[[`, `[` and `test` are often used within `if...fi` constructs in the conditional commands position: which is between the 'if' and the 'then.'

There are certain shell syntaxes which can be wrapped directly around simple commands, in particular:

- (1) `{ ...;}`, group commands,
- (2) `$( ... )`, command substitutions,
- (3) `<( ... )` and `>( ... )`, process substitutions,
- (4) `( ... )`, subshells, and
- (5) `$(( ... ))` and `(( ... ))`, arithmetic evaluations.

Some examples include:

- (1) `{ echo {a..z}; echo {0..9};} > ~/f`,
- (2) `[[ $(logname) == $LOGNAME ]]`,
- (3) `readarray -t files < <( find ...)`,
- (4) `(cd /foo || exit 1; tar ...)`, and
- (5) `dd bs=$((2**12)) count=1 if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zeroed-block`, respectively.

Note how in example (2) `logname` is enclosed directly within a command substitution, which is itself enclosed within a `[[` reserved word / conditional expression / compound command.

If you want to check the exit status of a certain command, use that command directly as demonstrated in the correct code, above.

If you want to check the output of a command, use `"$(..)"` to get its output, and then use `test`/`[` or `[[` to do a string comparison:

```
#cb5-1# Check output of `whoami` against the string `root`
#cb5-2if [ "$(whoami)" = "root" ]
#cb5-3then
#cb5-4  echo "Running as root"
#cb5-5fi
```

### Exceptions:

None.
