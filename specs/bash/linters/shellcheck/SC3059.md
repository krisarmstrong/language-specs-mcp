## In POSIX sh, case modification is undefined.

(or "In dash, ... is not supported." when using `dash`)

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1#!/bin/sh
#cb1-2x='test'
#cb1-3echo "${x^^[t]}"
```

### Correct code:

The easiest solution is to switch to a shell that does support name matching prefixes, like `bash`:

```
#cb2-1#!/bin/bash
#cb2-2x='test'
#cb2-3echo "${x^^[t]}"
```

Alternatively, use external tools like `tr` for case conversion

```
#cb3-1#!/bin/sh
#cb3-2x='test'
#cb3-3echo "$x" | tr 't' 'T'
```

### Rationale:

Case modification in parameter expansion (e.g., `${x^^}`, `${x,,}`, `${x^}`, `${x,[pattern]}`) is a bash and ksh extension. dash and POSIX sh do not support it.

### Exceptions:

If you only intend to target shells that supports this feature, you can change the shebang to a shell that guarantees support, or [ignore](ignore) this warning.

You can use `# shellcheck disable=SC3000-SC4000` to ignore all such compatibility warnings.
