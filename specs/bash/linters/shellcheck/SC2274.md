## Command name starts with `===`. Intended as a commented border?

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1===================== MAIN SECTION =======================
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1# ===================== MAIN SECTION =======================
```

### Rationale:

ShellCheck found a command that starts with a series of `===`s. This may have been intended as a border, but is missing the `#` to turn it into a harmless comment.

### Exceptions:

None
