## To assign the output of a command, use `var=$(cmd)` .

### Problematic code:

```
#cb1-1var=grep -c pattern file
```

### Correct code:

```
#cb2-1var=$(grep -c pattern file)
```

### Rationale:

To assign the output of a command to a variable, use `$(command substitution)`. Just typing a command after the `=` sign does not work.

### Exceptions:

None.

This warning triggers generally for `var=value -flag` and `var=value *glob*`. See related warning [SC2209](SC2209) which matches `var=commonCommand`.

[ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) is a static analysis tool for shell scripts. This page is part of its documentation.
