## Dart 3

[#](#dart-3)

 The Dart 3 language specification is in progress and not yet up to date for the current release and language features. You can find the in-progress specification in PDF format: 

- [Latest, in-progress specification](https://dart.dev/to/spec-draft) (produced from a [LaTeX file](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/main/specification/dartLangSpec.tex)) 

 New language features are typically described using informal language feature specifications in the [dart-lang/language](https://github.com/dart-lang/language) repo: 

- [Accepted informal proposals](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/main/accepted)
- [Drafts of potential features](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/tree/main/working)

 Over time, these feature specifications will be incorporated into the official specification. 

merge_typeVersion note

 Dart 3 changed the Dart language in a few ways, primarily requiring [sound null safety](/null-safety). 

## Dart 2

[#](#dart-2)

The Dart 2 language specification is available in PDF format:

- [Formal specification (Dart 2.10)](/resources/language/spec/versions/DartLangSpec-v2.10.pdf)

 For information on Dart versions 2.12 and later, which have support for [null safety](/null-safety), check out the in-progress [Dart 3 specification](#dart-3). 

## Dart 1.x

[#](#dart-1-x)

 The formal Dart 1.x language specification is available from the Ecma International website: 

- [Dart Programming Language Specification, 4th Edition](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-408/)
