## [§](#the-rust-standard-library)The Rust Standard Library

The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust
ecosystem](https://crates.io). It offers core types, like [Vec<T>](vec/struct.Vec.html) and [Option<T>](option/enum.Option.html), library-defined [operations on language
primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O](io/index.html) and [multithreading](thread/index.html), among [many other things](#what-is-in-the-standard-library-documentation).

`std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the standard library can be accessed in [use](../book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html) statements through the path `std`, as in [use std::env](env/index.html).

## [§](#how-to-read-this-documentation)How to read this documentation

If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to find it is to use the [search
button](#) at the top of the page.

Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:

- [std::* modules](#modules)
- [Primitive types](#primitives)
- [Standard macros](#macros)
- [The Rust Prelude](prelude/index.html)

If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits you don’t want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and its documentation!

Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your development you may want to press the “ Summary” button near the top of the page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.

While you are looking at the top of the page, also notice the “Source” link. Rust’s API documentation comes with the source code and you are encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high quality and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.

## [§](#what-is-in-the-standard-library-documentation)What is in the standard library documentation?

First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules). These modules are the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names like [std::slice](slice/index.html) and [std::cmp](cmp/index.html). Modules’ documentation typically includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.

Second, implicit methods on [primitive types](../book/ch03-02-data-types.html) are documented here. This can be a source of confusion for two reasons:

1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only library that does so), which are [documented in the section on
primitives](#primitives).
2. The standard library exports many modules with the same name as primitive types. These define additional items related to the primitive type, but not the all-important methods.

So for example there is a [page for the primitive type
char](primitive.char.html) that lists all the methods that can be called on characters (very useful), and there is a [page for the module
std::char](char/index.html) that documents iterator and error types created by these methods (rarely useful).

Note the documentation for the primitives [str](primitive.str.html) and [[T]](primitive.slice.html) (also called ‘slice’). Many method calls on [String](string/struct.String.html) and [Vec<T>](vec/struct.Vec.html) are actually calls to methods on [str](primitive.str.html) and [[T]](primitive.slice.html) respectively, via [deref
coercions](../book/ch15-02-deref.html#implicit-deref-coercions-with-functions-and-methods).

Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude](prelude/index.html), a small collection of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.

And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not all of the standard macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the standard macros are imported by default into all crates.

## [§](#a-tour-of-the-rust-standard-library)A Tour of The Rust Standard Library

The rest of this crate documentation is dedicated to pointing out notable features of The Rust Standard Library.

### [§](#containers-and-collections)Containers and collections

The [option](option/index.html) and [result](result/index.html) modules define optional and error-handling types, [Option<T>](option/enum.Option.html) and [Result<T, E>](result/enum.Result.html). The [iter](iter/index.html) module defines Rust’s iterator trait, [Iterator](iter/trait.Iterator.html), which works with the [for](../book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for) loop to access collections.

The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous regions of memory:

- [Vec<T>](vec/struct.Vec.html) - A heap-allocated vector that is resizable at runtime.
- [[T; N]](primitive.array.html) - An inline array with a fixed size at compile time.
- [[T]](primitive.slice.html) - A dynamically sized slice into any other kind of contiguous storage, whether heap-allocated or not.

Slices can only be handled through some kind of pointer, and as such come in many flavors such as:

- `&[T]` - shared slice
- `&mut [T]` - mutable slice
- [Box<[T]>](boxed/index.html) - owned slice

[str](primitive.str.html), a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library defines many methods for it. Rust [str](primitive.str.html)s are typically accessed as immutable references: `&str`. Use the owned [String](string/struct.String.html) for building and mutating strings.

For converting to strings use the [format!](macro.format.html) macro, and for converting from strings use the [FromStr](str/trait.FromStr.html) trait.

Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [Rc](rc/struct.Rc.html) type, and if further contained in a [Cell](cell/struct.Cell.html) or [RefCell](cell/struct.RefCell.html), may be mutated as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an atomically-reference-counted box, [Arc](sync/struct.Arc.html), with a [Mutex](sync/struct.Mutex.html) to get the same effect.

The [collections](collections/index.html) module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other typical collection types, including the common [HashMap<K, V>](collections/struct.HashMap.html).

### [§](#platform-abstractions-and-io)Platform abstractions and I/O

Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and Unix derivatives.

Common types of I/O, including [files](fs/struct.File.html), [TCP](net/struct.TcpStream.html), and [UDP](net/struct.UdpSocket.html), are defined in the [io](io/index.html), [fs](fs/index.html), and [net](net/index.html) modules.

The [thread](thread/index.html) module contains Rust’s threading abstractions. [sync](sync/index.html) contains further primitive shared memory types, including [atomic](sync/atomic/index.html), [mpmc](sync/mpmc/index.html) and [mpsc](sync/mpsc/index.html), which contains the channel types for message passing.

## [§](#use-before-and-after-main)Use before and after `main()`

Many parts of the standard library are expected to work before and after `main()`; but this is not guaranteed or ensured by tests. It is recommended that you write your own tests and run them on each platform you wish to support. This means that use of `std` before/after main, especially of features that interact with the OS or global state, is exempted from stability and portability guarantees and instead only provided on a best-effort basis. Nevertheless bug reports are appreciated.

On the other hand `core` and `alloc` are most likely to work in such environments with the caveat that any hookable behavior such as panics, oom handling or allocators will also depend on the compatibility of the hooks.

Some features may also behave differently outside main, e.g. stdio could become unbuffered, some panics might turn into aborts, backtraces might not get symbolicated or similar.

Non-exhaustive list of known limitations:

- after-main use of thread-locals, which also affects additional features: 

  - [thread::current()](thread/fn.current.html)

- under UNIX, before main, file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 may be unchanged (they are guaranteed to be open during main, and are opened to /dev/null O_RDWR if they weren’t open on program start)
