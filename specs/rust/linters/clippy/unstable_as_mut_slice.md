## absolute_paths [¶](#absolute_paths)📋restrictionallow

### What it does

Checks for usage of items through absolute paths, like `std::env::current_dir`.

### Why restrict this?

Many codebases have their own style when it comes to importing, but one that is seldom used is using absolute paths everywhere. This is generally considered unidiomatic, and you should add a `use` statement.

The default maximum segments (2) is pretty strict, you may want to increase this in `clippy.toml`.

Note: One exception to this is code from macro expansion - this does not lint such cases, as using absolute paths is the proper way of referencing items in one.

### Known issues

There are currently a few cases which are not caught by this lint:

- Macro calls. e.g. `path::to::macro!()`
- Derive macros. e.g. `#[derive(path::to::macro)]`
- Attribute macros. e.g. `#[path::to::macro]`

### Example

```
let x = std::f64::consts::PI;
```

Use any of the below instead, or anything else:

```
use std::f64;
use std::f64::consts;
use std::f64::consts::PI;
let x = f64::consts::PI;
let x = consts::PI;
let x = PI;
use std::f64::consts as f64_consts;
let x = f64_consts::PI;
```

### Configuration

- 

`absolute-paths-allowed-crates`: Which crates to allow absolute paths from

(default: `[]`)

- 

`absolute-paths-max-segments`: The maximum number of segments a path can have before being linted, anything above this will be linted.

(default: `2`)
