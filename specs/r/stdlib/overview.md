CRAN: Manuals

# R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing

## The R Manuals

edited by the R Core Team. 

 The following manuals for R were created on Debian Linux and may differ from the manuals for Mac or Windows on platform-specific pages, but most parts will be identical for all platforms. The correct version of the manuals for each platform are part of the respective R installations. The manuals change with R, hence we provide versions for the most recent released R version (R-release), a very current version for the patched release version (R-patched) and finally a version for the forthcoming R version that is still in development (R-devel). 

 Here they can be downloaded as PDF files, EPUB files, or directly browsed as HTML:

The LaTeX or Texinfo sources of the latest version of these documents are contained in every R source distribution (in the subdirectory doc/manual of the extracted archive). Older versions of the manual can be found in the respective [archives of
the R sources](src/base/). The HTML versions of the manuals are also part of most R installations (accessible using function `help.start()`). 

Please check the manuals for R-devel before reporting any issues with the released versions.
