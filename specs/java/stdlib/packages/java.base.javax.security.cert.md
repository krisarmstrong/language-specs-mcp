# Package javax.security.cert

package javax.security.certProvides classes for public key certificates. The classes in this package have been deprecated. New classes should not be added to this package. These classes include a simplified version of the `java.security.cert` package. These classes were developed as part of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE). When JSSE was added to the J2SE version 1.4, this package was added for backward-compatibility reasons only. New applications should not use this package, but rather `java.security.cert`.Since:1.4
