# Package javax.swing.event

package javax.swing.eventProvides for events fired by Swing components. It contains event classes and corresponding event listener interfaces for events fired by Swing components in addition to those events in the [java.awt.event](../../../java/awt/event/package-summary.html) package. 

Note: Most of the Swing API is not thread safe. For details, see [Concurrency in Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html), a section in [The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).
