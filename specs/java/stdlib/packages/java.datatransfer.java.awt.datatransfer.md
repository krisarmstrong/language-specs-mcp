# Package java.awt.datatransfer

package java.awt.datatransferProvides interfaces and classes for transferring data between and within applications. It defines the notion of a "transferable" object, which is an object capable of being transferred between or within applications. An object identifies itself as being transferable by implementing the Transferable interface. 

 It also provides a clipboard mechanism, which is an object that temporarily holds a transferable object that can be transferred between or within an application. The clipboard is typically used for copy and paste operations. Although it is possible to create a clipboard to use within an application, most applications will use the system clipboard to ensure the data can be transferred across applications running on the platform.
