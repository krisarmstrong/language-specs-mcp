 For more information on using Java Sound see: 

- [The Java Sound Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/)

 Please note: In the `javax.sound.sampled` APIs, a `null` reference parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some later time. `NullPointerException` is an example of typical and acceptable run time exception for such cases.Since:1.3
