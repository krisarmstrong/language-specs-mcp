# Package javax.swing.tree

package javax.swing.treeProvides classes and interfaces for dealing with `javax.swing.JTree`. You use these classes and interfaces if you want control over how trees are constructed, updated, and rendered, as well as how data associated with the tree nodes are viewed and managed. 

Note: Most of the Swing API is not thread safe. For details, see [Concurrency in Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html), a section in [The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/).
