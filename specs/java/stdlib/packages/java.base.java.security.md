# Package java.security

package java.securityProvides the classes and interfaces for the security framework. This includes classes that implement an easily configurable, fine-grained access control security architecture. This package also supports the generation and storage of cryptographic public key pairs, as well as a number of exportable cryptographic operations including those for message digest and signature generation. Finally, this package provides classes that support signed/guarded objects and secure random number generation. Many of the classes provided in this package (the cryptographic and secure random number generator classes in particular) are provider-based. The class itself defines a programming interface to which applications may write. The implementations themselves may then be written by independent third-party vendors and plugged in seamlessly as needed. Therefore, application developers may take advantage of any number of provider-based implementations without having to add or rewrite code.
