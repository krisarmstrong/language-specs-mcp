Module[java.sql](../../module-summary.html)

# Package java.sql

package java.sqlProvides the API for accessing and processing data stored in a data source (usually a relational database) using the Java programming language. This API includes a framework whereby different drivers can be installed dynamically to access different data sources. Although the JDBC API is mainly geared to passing SQL statements to a database, it provides for reading and writing data from any data source with a tabular format. The reader/writer facility, available through the `javax.sql.RowSet` group of interfaces, can be customized to use and update data from a spread sheet, flat file, or any other tabular data source. 

## What the JDBC 4.3 API Includes

 The JDBC 4.3 API includes both the `java.sql` package, referred to as the JDBC core API, and the `javax.sql` package, referred to as the JDBC Optional Package API. This complete JDBC API is included in the Java Standard Edition (Java SE), version 7. The `javax.sql` package extends the functionality of the JDBC API from a client-side API to a server-side API, and it is an essential part of the Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) technology. 

## Versions

 The JDBC 4.3 API incorporates all of the previous JDBC API versions: 

-  The JDBC 4.2 API
-  The JDBC 4.1 API
-  The JDBC 4.0 API
-  The JDBC 3.0 API
-  The JDBC 2.1 core API
-  The JDBC 2.0 Optional Package API
 (Note that the JDBC 2.1 core API and the JDBC 2.0 Optional Package API together are referred to as the JDBC 2.0 API.)
-  The JDBC 1.2 API
-  The JDBC 1.0 API

 Classes, interfaces, methods, fields, constructors, and exceptions have the following "since" tags that indicate when they were introduced into the Java platform. When these "since" tags are used in Javadoc comments for the JDBC API, they indicate the following: 

- Since 9 -- new in the JDBC 4.3 API and part of the Java SE platform, version 9
- Since 1.8 -- new in the JDBC 4.2 API and part of the Java SE platform, version 8
- Since 1.7 -- new in the JDBC 4.1 API and part of the Java SE platform, version 7
- Since 1.6 -- new in the JDBC 4.0 API and part of the Java SE platform, version 6
- Since 1.4 -- new in the JDBC 3.0 API and part of the J2SE platform, version 1.4
- Since 1.2 -- new in the JDBC 2.0 API and part of the J2SE platform, version 1.2
- Since 1.1 or no "since" tag -- in the original JDBC 1.0 API and part of the JDK, version 1.1

NOTE: Many of the new features are optional; consequently, there is some variation in drivers and the features they support. Always check your driver's documentation to see whether it supports a feature before you try to use it. 

NOTE: The class `SQLPermission` was added in the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3 release. This class is used to prevent unauthorized access to the logging stream associated with the `DriverManager`, which may contain information such as table names, column data, and so on. 

## What the `java.sql` Package Contains

 The `java.sql` package contains API for the following:

- `RowSet` technology -- providing a convenient means of handling and passing data 

### Custom Mapping of UDTs

 A user-defined type (UDT) defined in SQL can be mapped to a class in the Java programming language. An SQL structured type or an SQL `DISTINCT` type are the UDTs that may be custom mapped. The following three steps set up a custom mapping: 

1. Defining the SQL structured type or `DISTINCT` type in SQL 
2. Defining the class in the Java programming language to which the SQL UDT will be mapped. This class must implement the `SQLData` interface. 
3. Making an entry in a `Connection` object's type map that contains two things: 

  - the fully-qualified SQL name of the UDT 
  - the `Class` object for the class that implements the `SQLData` interface 

 When these are in place for a UDT, calling the methods `ResultSet.getObject` or `CallableStatement.getObject` on that UDT will automatically retrieve the custom mapping for it. Also, the `PreparedStatement.setObject` method will automatically map the object back to its SQL type to store it in the data source.
