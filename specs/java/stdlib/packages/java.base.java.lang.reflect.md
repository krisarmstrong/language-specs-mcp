# Package java.lang.reflect

package java.lang.reflectProvides classes and interfaces for obtaining reflective information about classes and objects. Reflection allows programmatic access to information about the fields, methods, and constructors of loaded classes, and the use of reflected fields, methods, and constructors to operate on their underlying counterparts, within encapsulation and security restrictions. 

Classes in this package, along with `java.lang.Class` accommodate applications such as debuggers, interpreters, object inspectors, class browsers, and services such as Object Serialization and JavaBeans that need access to either the public members of a target object (based on its runtime class) or the members declared by a given class. 

[AccessibleObject](AccessibleObject.html) allows suppression of access checks if the necessary [ReflectPermission](ReflectPermission.html) is available. 

[Array](Array.html) provides static methods to dynamically create and access arrays. 

## Java programming language and JVM modeling in core reflection

 The components of core reflection, which include types in this package as well as [Class](../Class.html), [Package](../Package.html), and [Module](../Module.html), fundamentally present a JVM model of the entities in question rather than a Java programming language model. A Java compiler, such as `javac`, translates Java source code into executable output that can be run on a JVM, primarily `class` files. Compilers for source languages other than Java can and do target the JVM as well. 

The translation process, including from Java language sources, to executable output for the JVM is not a one-to-one mapping. Structures present in the source language may have no representation in the output and structures not present in the source language may be present in the output. The latter are called synthetic structures. Synthetic structures can include [methods](Method.html#isSynthetic()), [fields](Field.html#isSynthetic()), [parameters](Parameter.html#isSynthetic()), [classes and
 interfaces](../Class.html#isSynthetic()). One particular kind of synthetic method is a [bridge method](Method.html#isBridge()). It is possible a synthetic structure may not be marked as such. In particular, not all `class` file versions support marking a parameter as synthetic. A source language compiler generally has multiple ways to translate a source program into a `class` file representation. The translation may also depend on the version of the `class` file format being targeted as different `class` file versions have different capabilities and features. In some cases the modifiers present in the `class` file representation may differ from the modifiers on the originating element in the source language, including [final](Modifier.html#FINAL) on a [parameter](Parameter.html#getModifiers()) and `protected`, `private`, and `static` on [classes and interfaces](../Class.html#getModifiers()). 

Besides differences in structural representation between the source language and the JVM representation, core reflection also exposes runtime specific information. For example, the [class loaders](../Class.html#getClassLoader()) and [protection domains](../Class.html#getProtectionDomain()) of a `Class` are runtime concepts without a direct analogue in source code.
