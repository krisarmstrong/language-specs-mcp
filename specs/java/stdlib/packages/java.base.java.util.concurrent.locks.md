# Package java.util.concurrent.locks

package java.util.concurrent.locksInterfaces and classes providing a framework for locking and waiting for conditions that is distinct from built-in synchronization and monitors. The framework permits much greater flexibility in the use of locks and conditions, at the expense of more awkward syntax. 

The [Lock](Lock.html) interface supports locking disciplines that differ in semantics (reentrant, fair, etc), and that can be used in non-block-structured contexts including hand-over-hand and lock reordering algorithms. The main implementation is [ReentrantLock](ReentrantLock.html). 

The [ReadWriteLock](ReadWriteLock.html) interface similarly defines locks that may be shared among readers but are exclusive to writers. Only a single implementation, [ReentrantReadWriteLock](ReentrantReadWriteLock.html), is provided, since it covers most standard usage contexts. But programmers may create their own implementations to cover nonstandard requirements. 

The [Condition](Condition.html) interface describes condition variables that may be associated with Locks. These are similar in usage to the implicit monitors accessed using `Object.wait`, but offer extended capabilities. In particular, multiple `Condition` objects may be associated with a single `Lock`. To avoid compatibility issues, the names of `Condition` methods are different from the corresponding `Object` versions. 

The [AbstractQueuedSynchronizer](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.html) class serves as a useful superclass for defining locks and other synchronizers that rely on queuing blocked threads. The [AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer](AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.html) class provides the same functionality but extends support to 64 bits of synchronization state. Both extend class [AbstractOwnableSynchronizer](AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.html), a simple class that helps record the thread currently holding exclusive synchronization. The [LockSupport](LockSupport.html) class provides lower-level blocking and unblocking support that is useful for those developers implementing their own customized lock classes.
