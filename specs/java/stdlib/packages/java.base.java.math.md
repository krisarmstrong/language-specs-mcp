# Package java.math

package java.mathProvides classes for performing arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic (`BigInteger`) and arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic (`BigDecimal`). `BigInteger` is analogous to the primitive integer types except that it provides arbitrary precision, hence operations on `BigInteger`s do not overflow or lose precision. In addition to standard arithmetic operations, `BigInteger` provides modular arithmetic, GCD calculation, primality testing, prime generation, bit manipulation, and a few other miscellaneous operations. `BigDecimal` provides arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers suitable for currency calculations and the like. `BigDecimal` gives the user complete control over rounding behavior, allowing the user to choose from a comprehensive set of eight rounding modes.Since:1.1
