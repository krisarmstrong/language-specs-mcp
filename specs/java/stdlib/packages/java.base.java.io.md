# Package java.io

package java.ioProvides for system input and output through data streams, serialization and the file system. Unless otherwise noted, passing a `null` argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will cause a `NullPointerException` to be thrown. A pathname string passed as a `String` argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will be interpreted as described in the class specification of [File](File.html). 

## Object Serialization

Warning: Deserialization of untrusted data is inherently dangerous and should be avoided. Untrusted data should be carefully validated according to the "Serialization and Deserialization" section of the [Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE](https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=javase21&id=secure_coding_guidelines_javase).
