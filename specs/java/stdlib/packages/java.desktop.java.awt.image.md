# Package java.awt.image

package java.awt.imageProvides classes for creating and modifying images. Images are processed using a streaming framework that involves an image producer, optional image filters, and an image consumer. This framework makes it possible to progressively render an image while it is being fetched and generated. Moreover, the framework allows an application to discard the storage used by an image and to regenerate it at any time. This package provides a number of image producers, consumers, and filters that you can configure for your image processing needs.Since:1.0
