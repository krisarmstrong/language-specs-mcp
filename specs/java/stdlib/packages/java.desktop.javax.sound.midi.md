 Please note: In the `javax.sound.midi` APIs, a `null` reference parameter to methods is incorrect unless explicitly documented on the method as having a meaningful interpretation. Usage to the contrary is incorrect coding and may result in a run time exception either immediately or at some later time. `NullPointerException` is an example of typical and acceptable run time exception for such cases.Since:1.3

- All Classes and InterfacesInterfacesClassesException ClassesClassDescription[ControllerEventListener](ControllerEventListener.html)The `ControllerEventListener` interface should be implemented by classes whose instances need to be notified when a [Sequencer](Sequencer.html) has processed a requested type of MIDI control-change event.[Instrument](Instrument.html)An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter settings, usually designed to emulate a specific real-world musical instrument or to achieve a specific sort of sound effect.[InvalidMidiDataException](InvalidMidiDataException.html)An `InvalidMidiDataException` indicates that inappropriate MIDI data was encountered.[MetaEventListener](MetaEventListener.html)The `MetaEventListener` interface should be implemented by classes whose instances need to be notified when a [Sequencer](Sequencer.html) has processed a [MetaMessage](MetaMessage.html).[MetaMessage](MetaMessage.html)A `MetaMessage` is a [MidiMessage](MidiMessage.html) that is not meaningful to synthesizers, but that can be stored in a MIDI file and interpreted by a sequencer program.[MidiChannel](MidiChannel.html)A `MidiChannel` object represents a single MIDI channel.[MidiDevice](MidiDevice.html)`MidiDevice` is the base interface for all MIDI devices.[MidiDevice.Info](MidiDevice.Info.html)A `MidiDevice.Info` object contains assorted data about a [MidiDevice](MidiDevice.html), including its name, the company who created it, and descriptive text.[MidiDeviceReceiver](MidiDeviceReceiver.html)`MidiDeviceReceiver` is a `Receiver` which represents a MIDI input connector of a `MidiDevice` (see [MidiDevice.getReceiver()](MidiDevice.html#getReceiver())).[MidiDeviceTransmitter](MidiDeviceTransmitter.html)`MidiDeviceTransmitter` is a `Transmitter` which represents a MIDI input connector of a `MidiDevice` (see [MidiDevice.getTransmitter()](MidiDevice.html#getTransmitter())).[MidiEvent](MidiEvent.html)MIDI events contain a MIDI message and a corresponding time-stamp expressed in ticks, and can represent the MIDI event information stored in a MIDI file or a [Sequence](Sequence.html) object.[MidiFileFormat](MidiFileFormat.html)A `MidiFileFormat` object encapsulates a MIDI file's type, as well as its length and timing information.[MidiMessage](MidiMessage.html)`MidiMessage` is the base class for MIDI messages.[MidiSystem](MidiSystem.html)The `MidiSystem` class provides access to the installed MIDI system resources, including devices such as synthesizers, sequencers, and MIDI input and output ports.[MidiUnavailableException](MidiUnavailableException.html)A `MidiUnavailableException` is thrown when a requested MIDI component cannot be opened or created because it is unavailable.[Patch](Patch.html)A `Patch` object represents a location, on a MIDI synthesizer, into which a single instrument is stored (loaded).[Receiver](Receiver.html)A `Receiver` receives [MidiEvent](MidiEvent.html) objects and typically does something useful in response, such as interpreting them to generate sound or raw MIDI output.[Sequence](Sequence.html)A `Sequence` is a data structure containing musical information (often an entire song or composition) that can be played back by a [Sequencer](Sequencer.html) object.[Sequencer](Sequencer.html)A hardware or software device that plays back a MIDI [sequence](Sequence.html) is known as a sequencer.[Sequencer.SyncMode](Sequencer.SyncMode.html)A `SyncMode` object represents one of the ways in which a MIDI sequencer's notion of time can be synchronized with a master or slave device.[ShortMessage](ShortMessage.html)A `ShortMessage` contains a MIDI message that has at most two data bytes following its status byte.[Soundbank](Soundbank.html)A `Soundbank` contains a set of `Instruments` that can be loaded into a `Synthesizer`.[SoundbankResource](SoundbankResource.html)A `SoundbankResource` represents any audio resource stored in a [Soundbank](Soundbank.html).[Synthesizer](Synthesizer.html)A `Synthesizer` generates sound.[SysexMessage](SysexMessage.html)A `SysexMessage` object represents a MIDI system exclusive message.[Track](Track.html)A MIDI track is an independent stream of MIDI events (time-stamped MIDI data) that can be stored along with other tracks in a standard MIDI file.[Transmitter](Transmitter.html)A `Transmitter` sends [MidiEvent](MidiEvent.html) objects to one or more [Receivers](Receiver.html).[VoiceStatus](VoiceStatus.html)A `VoiceStatus` object contains information about the current status of one of the voices produced by a [Synthesizer](Synthesizer.html).
