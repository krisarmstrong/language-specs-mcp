# Package com.sun.jdi.event

package com.sun.jdi.eventThis package defines JDI events and event processing. An [Event](Event.html) is always a member of an [EventSet](EventSet.html), which is retrieved from the [EventQueue](EventQueue.html). Examples of Events include ["breakpoints events"](BreakpointEvent.html), ["thread creation events"](ThreadStartEvent.html) and ["virtual machine death event"](VMDeathEvent.html). With the exception of termination events, all events received must be requested with an ["EventRequest"](../request/EventRequest.html). The [com.sun.jdi.request](../request/package-summary.html) package defines event requests and event request management. 

 Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard extension.
