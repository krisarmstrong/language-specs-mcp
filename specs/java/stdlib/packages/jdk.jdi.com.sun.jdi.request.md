# Package com.sun.jdi.request

package com.sun.jdi.requestThis package is used to request that a JDI event be sent under specified conditions. With the exception of termination events, which are always sent, there is one kind of [EventRequest](EventRequest.html) for each kind of [Event](../event/Event.html) - for example, [BreakpointRequest](BreakpointRequest.html) is used to request a [BreakpointEvent](../event/BreakpointEvent.html). Event requests are created by the [EventRequestManager](EventRequestManager.html). Events and event processing are defined in the [com.sun.jdi.event](../event/package-summary.html) package. 

 Methods may be added to the interfaces in the JDI packages in future releases. Existing packages may be renamed if the JDI becomes a standard extension.
