# Package javax.xml.crypto.dsig

package javax.xml.crypto.dsigClasses for generating and validating XML digital signatures. This package includes classes that represent the core elements defined in the W3C XML digital signature specification: [XMLSignature](XMLSignature.html), [SignedInfo](SignedInfo.html), [CanonicalizationMethod](CanonicalizationMethod.html), [SignatureMethod](SignatureMethod.html), [Reference](Reference.html), [DigestMethod](DigestMethod.html), [XMLObject](XMLObject.html), [Manifest](Manifest.html), [SignatureProperties](SignatureProperties.html), and [SignatureProperty](SignatureProperty.html). `KeyInfo` types are defined in the [javax.xml.crypto.dsig.keyinfo](keyinfo/package-summary.html) subpackage. [XMLSignatureFactory](XMLSignatureFactory.html) is an abstract factory that creates [XMLSignature](XMLSignature.html) objects from scratch or from a pre-existing XML representation, such as a DOM node. [TransformService](TransformService.html) is a service provider interface for creating and plugging in implementations of transform and canonicalization algorithms. 

Of primary significance in this package is the [XMLSignature](XMLSignature.html) class, which allows you to sign and validate an XML digital signature. 

## Service Providers

 A service provider is a concrete implementation of the abstract [XMLSignatureFactory](XMLSignatureFactory.html) and [KeyInfoFactory](keyinfo/KeyInfoFactory.html) classes and is responsible for creating objects and algorithms that parse, generate and validate XML Signatures and KeyInfo structures. A concrete implementation of `XMLSignatureFactory` MUST provide support for each of the REQUIRED algorithms as specified by the W3C recommendation for XML Signatures. It MAY support other algorithms as defined by the W3C recommendation or other specifications. 

The API leverages the JCA provider model (see [the Provider class](../../../../../java.base/java/security/Provider.html)) for registering and loading `XMLSignatureFactory` and `KeyInfoFactory` implementations. 

Each concrete `XMLSignatureFactory` or `KeyInfoFactory` implementation supports a specific XML mechanism type that identifies the XML processing mechanism that an implementation uses internally to parse and generate XML signature and KeyInfo structures. 

A service provider implementation SHOULD use underlying JCA engine classes, such as [Signature](../../../../../java.base/java/security/Signature.html) and [MessageDigest](../../../../../java.base/java/security/MessageDigest.html) to perform cryptographic operations. 

In addition to the `XMLSignatureFactory` and `KeyInfoFactory` classes, the API supports a service provider interface for transform and canonicalization algorithms. The [TransformService](TransformService.html) class allows you to develop and plug in an implementation of a specific transform or canonicalization algorithm for a particular XML mechanism type. The `TransformService` class uses the standard JCA provider model for registering and loading implementations. Each service provider implementation SHOULD use the `TransformService` class to find a provider that supports transform and canonicalization algorithms in XML Signatures that it is generating or validating. 

### DOM Mechanism Requirements

 The following requirements MUST be abided by when implementing a DOM-based `XMLSignatureFactory`, `KeyInfoFactory` or `TransformService` in order to minimize interoperability problems: 

1. The `unmarshalXMLSignature` method of `XMLSignatureFactory` MUST support `DOMValidateContext` types. If the type is `DOMValidateContext`, it SHOULD contain an `Element` of type Signature. Additionally, the `unmarshalXMLSignature` method MAY populate the Id/Element mappings of the passed-in `DOMValidateContext`. 
2. The `sign` method of `XMLSignature`s produced by `XMLSignatureFactory` MUST support `DOMSignContext` types and the `validate` method MUST support `DOMValidateContext` types. This requirement also applies to the `validate` method of `SignatureValue` and the `validate` method of `Reference`.
3. The implementation MUST support `DOMStructure`s as the mechanism for the application to specify extensible content (any elements or mixed content).
4. If the `dereference` method of user-specified `URIDereferencer`s returns `NodeSetData` objects, the `iterator` method MUST return an iteration over objects of type `org.w3c.dom.Node`.
5. `URIReference` objects passed to the `dereference` method of user-specified `URIDereferencer`s MUST be of type `DOMURIReference` and `XMLCryptoContext` objects MUST implement `DOMCryptoContext`.
6. The previous 2 requirements also apply to `URIDereferencer`s returned by the `getURIDereferencer` method of `XMLSignatureFactory` and `KeyInfoFactory`.
7. The `unmarshalKeyInfo` method of `KeyInfoFactory` MUST support `DOMStructure` types. If the type is `DOMStructure`, it SHOULD contain an `Element` of type `KeyInfo`.
8. The `transform` method of `Transform` MUST support `DOMCryptoContext` context parameter types.
9. The `newtransform` and `newCanonicalizationMethod` methods of `XMLSignatureFactory` MUST support `DOMStructure` parameter types.
10. The `init`, and `marshalParams` methods of `TransformService` MUST support `DOMStructure` and `DOMCryptoContext` types.
11. The `unmarshalXMLSignature` method of `XMLSignatureFactory` MUST support `DOMStructure` types. If the type is `DOMStructure`, it SHOULD contain an `Element` of type `Signature`.
12. The `marshal` method of `KeyInfo` MUST support `DOMStructure` and `DOMCryptoContext` parameter types.

Note that a DOM implementation MAY internally use other XML parsing APIs other than DOM as long as it doesn't affect interoperability. For example, a DOM implementation of `XMLSignatureFactory` might use a SAX parser internally to canonicalize data.
