# Package java.beans.beancontext

package java.beans.beancontextProvides classes and interfaces relating to bean context. A bean context is a container for beans and defines the execution environment for the beans it contains. There can be several beans in a single bean context, and a bean context can be nested within another bean context. This package also contains events and listener interface for beans being added and removed from a bean context.Since:1.2

- All Classes and InterfacesInterfacesClassesClassDescription[BeanContext](BeanContext.html) The BeanContext acts a logical hierarchical container for JavaBeans.[BeanContextChild](BeanContextChild.html) JavaBeans wishing to be nested within, and obtain a reference to their execution environment, or context, as defined by the BeanContext sub-interface shall implement this interface.[BeanContextChildComponentProxy](BeanContextChildComponentProxy.html) This interface is implemented by `BeanContextChildren` that have an AWT `Component` associated with them.[BeanContextChildSupport](BeanContextChildSupport.html) This is a general support class to provide support for implementing the BeanContextChild protocol.[BeanContextContainerProxy](BeanContextContainerProxy.html) This interface is implemented by BeanContexts' that have an AWT Container associated with them.[BeanContextEvent](BeanContextEvent.html)`BeanContextEvent` is the abstract root event class for all events emitted from, and pertaining to the semantics of, a `BeanContext`.[BeanContextMembershipEvent](BeanContextMembershipEvent.html)A `BeanContextMembershipEvent` encapsulates the list of children added to, or removed from, the membership of a particular `BeanContext`.[BeanContextMembershipListener](BeanContextMembershipListener.html) Compliant BeanContexts fire events on this interface when the state of the membership of the BeanContext changes.[BeanContextProxy](BeanContextProxy.html) This interface is implemented by a JavaBean that does not directly have a BeanContext(Child) associated with it (via implementing that interface or a subinterface thereof), but has a public BeanContext(Child) delegated from it.[BeanContextServiceAvailableEvent](BeanContextServiceAvailableEvent.html) This event type is used by the BeanContextServicesListener in order to identify the service being registered.[BeanContextServiceProvider](BeanContextServiceProvider.html) One of the primary functions of a BeanContext is to act a as rendezvous between JavaBeans, and BeanContextServiceProviders.[BeanContextServiceProviderBeanInfo](BeanContextServiceProviderBeanInfo.html)A BeanContextServiceProvider implementor who wishes to provide explicit information about the services their bean may provide shall implement a BeanInfo class that implements this BeanInfo subinterface and provides explicit information about the methods, properties, events, etc, of their services.[BeanContextServiceRevokedEvent](BeanContextServiceRevokedEvent.html) This event type is used by the `BeanContextServiceRevokedListener` in order to identify the service being revoked.[BeanContextServiceRevokedListener](BeanContextServiceRevokedListener.html)The listener interface for receiving `BeanContextServiceRevokedEvent` objects.[BeanContextServices](BeanContextServices.html) The BeanContextServices interface provides a mechanism for a BeanContext to expose generic "services" to the BeanContextChild objects within.[BeanContextServicesListener](BeanContextServicesListener.html)The listener interface for receiving `BeanContextServiceAvailableEvent` objects.[BeanContextServicesSupport](BeanContextServicesSupport.html) This helper class provides a utility implementation of the java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextServices interface.[BeanContextServicesSupport.BCSSServiceProvider](BeanContextServicesSupport.BCSSServiceProvider.html)subclasses may subclass this nested class to add behaviors for each BeanContextServicesProvider.[BeanContextSupport](BeanContextSupport.html)This helper class provides a utility implementation of the java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext interface.[BeanContextSupport.BCSIterator](BeanContextSupport.BCSIterator.html)protected final subclass that encapsulates an iterator but implements a noop remove() method.
