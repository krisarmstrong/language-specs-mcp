# Package java.rmi.server

package java.rmi.serverProvides classes and interfaces for supporting the server side of RMI. One group of classes are used by the static stubs and skeletons. Another group of classes implements the RMI Transport protocol. 

Deprecated: Skeletons and Static Stubs.Skeletons and statically generated stubs are deprecated. This includes the APIs in this package that require the use of skeletons or static stubs and the runtime support for them. Support for skeletons and static stubs may be removed in a future release of the platform. Skeletons are unnecessary, as server-side method dispatching is handled directly by the RMI runtime. Statically generated stubs are unnecessary, as stubs are generated dynamically using [Proxy](../../../../java.base/java/lang/reflect/Proxy.html) objects. See [UnicastRemoteObject](UnicastRemoteObject.html) for information about dynamic stub generation.
