# Package java.awt.event

package java.awt.eventProvides interfaces and classes for dealing with different types of events fired by AWT components. See the [java.awt.AWTEvent](../AWTEvent.html) class for details on the AWT event model. Events are fired by event sources. An event listener registers with an event source to receive notifications about the events of a particular type. This package defines events and event listeners, as well as event listener adapters, which are convenience classes to make easier the process of writing event listeners.Since:1.1
